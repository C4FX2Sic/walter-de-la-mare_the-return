The       silence in which it lay seemed as keen</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">mellow as the light—the       pale</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">almost heatless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sunlight that filled the air. Here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there robins       sang across the stones</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">elvishly shrill in the quiet of harvest.

An increasing inclination for such       lonely ramblings</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">together with the feeling that his continued ill-health       had grown a little irksome to his wife</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that now that he was really       better she would be relieved at his absence</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had induced him to wander on       from home without much considering where the quiet lanes were leading him.       And in spite of a peculiar melancholy that had welled up into his mind       during these last few days</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he had certainly smiled with a faint sense of       the irony of things on lifting his eyes in an unusually depressed       moodiness to find himself looking down on the shadows</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">peace of       Widderstone.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       With that anxious irresolution which illness so often brings in its train       he had hesitated for a few minutes before actually entering the graveyard.       But once safely within he had begun to feel extremely loth to think of       turning back again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this not the less at remembering with a real       foreboding that it was now drawing towards evening</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that another day was       nearly done. He trailed his umbrella behind him over the grass-grown       paths</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">staying here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there to read some time-worn inscription</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stooping       a little broodingly over the dark green graves. Not for the first time       during the long laborious convalescence that had followed apparently so       slight an indisposition</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a fleeting sense almost as if of an       unintelligible remorse had overtaken him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a vague thought that behind all       these past years</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hidden as it were from his daily life</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lay something not       yet quite reckoned with. How often as a boy had he been rapped into a       galvanic activity out of the deep reveries he used to fall into—those       fits of a kind of fishlike day-dream. How often</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even far beyond       boyhood</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had he found himself bent on some distant thought or fleeting       vision that the sudden clash of self-possession had made to seem quite       illusory</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet had left so strangely haunting. And now the old habit       had stirred out of its long sleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">and</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">through the gate that Influenza in       departing had left ajar</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had returned upon him.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘But I suppose we are all pretty much the same</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if we only knew it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he       had consoled himself. ‘We keep our crazy side to ourselves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that’s all. We       just go on for years</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">years doing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">saying whatever happens to come       up—and really keen about it too’—he had glanced up with a kind       of challenge in his face at the squat little belfry—‘and then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">without the slightest reason or warning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">down you go</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it all begins to       wear thin</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you get wondering what on earth it all means.’ Memory       slipped back for an instant to the life that in so unusual a fashion       seemed to have floated a little aloof. Fortunately he had not discussed       these inward symptoms with his wife. How surprised Sheila would be to see       him loafing in this old</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">crooked churchyard. How she would lift her dark       eyebrows</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with that handsome</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">indifferent tolerance. He smiled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but a       little confusedly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet the thought gave even a spice of adventure to the       evening’s ramble.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He loitered on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">scarcely thinking at all now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stooping here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there.       These faint listless ideas made no more stir than the sunlight gilding the       fading leaves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the crisp turf underfoot. With a slight effort he stooped       even once again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">—     &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;      ‘Stranger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a moment pause</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stay</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">In this dim chamber hidden away      Lies one who once found life as dear      As now he finds his slumbers here:      Pray</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Judgement but increase      His deep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">everlasting peace!’  &lt;/pre&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘But then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">do you know you lie at peace?’ Lawford audibly questioned</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gazing at the doggerel. And yet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as his eyes wandered over the blunt green       stone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the rambling crimson-berried brier that had almost encircled it       with its thorns</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the echo of that whisper rather jarred. He was</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he       supposed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rather a dull creature—at least people seemed to think so—and       he seldom felt at ease even with his own small facetiousness. Besides</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just that kind of question was getting very common. Now that cleverness       was the fashion most people were clever—even perfect fools</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cleverness after all was often only a bore: all head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no body. He       turned languidly to the small cross-shaped stone on the other side:     &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;      ‘Here lies the body of Ann Hard</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">who died in child-bed.                  Also of James</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her infant son.’  &lt;/pre&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He muttered the words over with a kind of mournful bitterness. ‘That’s       just it—just it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that’s just how it goes!’... He yawned softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the       pathway had come to an end. Beyond him lay ranker grass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">one</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">another       obscurer mounds</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">an old scarred oak seat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shadowed by a few everlastingly       green cypresses</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">coral-fruited yew-trees.

He stood with       vacant eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not in the least aware how queer a figure he made with his       gloves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his umbrella</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his hat among the stained</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tottering       gravestones.

An utterly unreasonable feeling of dismay</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a sudden weakness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">weariness had come over him.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What is the good of it all?’ he asked himself inconsequently—this       monotonous</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">restless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stupid life to which he was soon to be returning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for good. He began to realize how ludicrous a spectacle he must be</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">kneeling here amid the weeds</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">grass beneath the solemn cypresses.       ‘Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you can’t have everything</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ seemed loosely to express his disquiet.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He stared vacantly at the green</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fretted gravestone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dimly aware that       his heart was beating with an unusual effort.

He drew off his glove</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">thrust his bare hand under his       waistcoat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with his mouth a little ajar</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his eyes fixed on the dark       square turret</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its bell sharply defined against the evening sky.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Dead!’ a bitter inward voice seemed to break into speech</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘Dead!’ The       viewless air seemed to be flocking with hidden listeners. The very       clearness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the crystal silence were their ambush. He alone seemed to be       the target of cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hostile scrutiny. There was not a breath to breathe       in this crisp</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pale sunshine. It was all too rare</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">too thin. The shadows       lay like wings everlastingly folded. The robin that had been his only       living witness lifted its throat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">broke</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if from the uttermost       outskirts of reality</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">into its shrill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">passionless song. Lawford moved       heavy eyes from one object to another—bird—sun-gilded stone—those       two small earth-worn faces—his hands—a stirring in the grass       as of some creature labouring to climb up. It was useless to sit here any       longer. He must go back now. Fancies were all very well for a change</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but       must be only occasional guests in a world devoted to reality. He leaned       his hand on the dark grey wood</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">closed his eyes. The lids presently       unsealed a little</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">momentarily revealing astonished</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">aggrieved pupils</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">slowly they again descended....     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The flaming rose that had swiftly surged from the west into the zenith</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dyeing all the churchyard grass a wild</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">vivid green</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the stooping       stones above it a pure faint purple</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">waned softly back like a falling       fountain into its basin. In a few minutes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only a faint orange burned in       the west</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dimly illuminating with its band of light the huddled figure on       his low wood seat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his right hand still pressed against a faintly beating       heart. Dusk gathered</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the first white stars appeared</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">out of the shadowy       fields a nightjar purred. But there was only the silence of the falling       dew among the graves. Down here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">under the ink-black cypresses</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the blades       of the grass were stooping with cold drops</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">darkness lay like the hem       of an enormous cloak</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">whose jewels above the breast of its wearer might be       in the unfathomable clearness the glittering constellations....     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       In his small cage of darkness Lawford shuddered</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">raised a furtive head.       He stood up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">peered eagerly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">strangely from side to side. He stayed       quite still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listening as raptly as some wandering night-beast to the       indiscriminate stir</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">echoings of the darkness. He cocked his head above       his shoulder</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listened again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then turned upon the soundless grass       towards the hill. He felt not the faintest astonishment or strangeness in       his solitude here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only a little chilled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">physically uneasy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet       in this vast darkness a faint spiritual exaltation seemed to hover.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He hastened up the narrow path</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">walking with knees a little bent</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like an       old labourer who has lived a life of stooping</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">came out into the dry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dusty lane. One moment his instinct hesitated as to which turn to take—only       a moment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he was soon walking swiftly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">almost trotting</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">downhill with this       vivid exaltation in the huge dark night in his heart</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila merely a       little angry Titianesque cloud on a scarcely perceptible horizon. He had       no notion of the time</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the golden hands of his watch were indiscernible in       the gloom. But presently</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he passed by</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he pressed his face close to       the cold glass of a little shop-window</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pierced that out by an old       Swiss cuckoo-clock. He would if he hurried just be home before dinner.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He broke into a slow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">steady trot</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gaining speed as he ran on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">vaguely       elated to find how well his breath was serving him. An odd smile darkened       his face at remembrance of the thoughts he had been thinking. There could       be little amiss with the heart of a man who could shamble along like this</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">taking even pleasure</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">an increasing pleasure in this long</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wolf-like       stride. He turned round occasionally to look into the face of some       fellow-wayfarer whom he had overtaken</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for he felt not only this unusual       animation</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this peculiar zest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but that</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a boy on some secret errand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he had slightly disguised his very presence</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was going masked</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as it were.       Even his clothes seemed to have connived at this queer illusion. No tailor       had for these ten years allowed him so much latitude. He cautiously at       last opened his garden gate</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with soundless agility mounted the six       stone steps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his latch-key ready in his gloveless hand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">softly let       himself into the house.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Sheila was out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it seemed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for the maid had forgotten to light the lamp.       Without pausing to take off his greatcoat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he hung up his hat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ran nimbly       upstairs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">knocked with a light knuckle on his bedroom door. It was       closed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but no answer came. He opened it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shut it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">locked it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sat down       on the bedside for a moment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the darkness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so that he could scarcely       hear any other sound</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he sat erect</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like some night animal</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wary of danger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">attentively alert. Then he rose from the bed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">threw off       his coat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">which was clammy with dew</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lit a candle on the       dressing-table.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Its narrow flame lengthened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drooped</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">brightened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gleamed clearly. He       glanced around him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unusually contented—at the ruddiness of the low       fire</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the brass bedstead</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the warm red curtains</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the soft silveriness here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there. It seemed as if a heavy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dull dream had withdrawn out of his       mind. He would go again some day</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sit on the little hard seat beside       the crooked tombstone of the friendless old Huguenot. He opened a drawer</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">took out his razors</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">and</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">faintly whistling</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">returned to the table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lit       a second candle. And still with this strange heightened sense of life       stirring in his mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he drew his hand gently over his chin</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looked       unto the glass.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       For an instant he stood head to foot icily still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">without the least       feeling</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or stir—staring into the looking-glass. Then an       inconceivable drumming beat on his ear. A warm surge</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like the onset of a       wave</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">broke in him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">flooding neck</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">forehead</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even his hands with       colour. He caught himself up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wheeled deliberately</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">completely       round</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his eyes darting to</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fro</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">suddenly to fix themselves in a       prolonged stare</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">while he took a deep breath</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">caught back his       self-possession</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">paused. Then he turned</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">once more confronted the       changed strange face in the glass.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Without a sound he drew up a chair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sat down</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just as he was</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">frigid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">appalled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at the foot of the bed.

His hands hung between his knees</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a deep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">settled frown darkened the       features stooping out of the direct rays of the light</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his eyes       wandered like busy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">inquisitive</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but stupid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">animals over the floor.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       If</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in that flood of unintelligible thoughts</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">anything clearly recurred at       all</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it was the memory of Sheila.

His lids narrowed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a vague       terror</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">horror mastered him.

It’s so very absurd—’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What is absurd?’ he asked dully.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">standing like this outside my own bedroom door. Are you ill?

I am not ill. I merely want a       little time to think in.’ There was again a brief pause</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then a slight       rattling at the handle.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Arthur</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I insist on knowing at once what’s wrong</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this does not sound a       bit like yourself. It is not even quite like your own voice.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘It is myself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he replied stubbornly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">staring fixedly into the glass. You       must give me a few moments</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila. Something has happened. My face. Come       back in an hour.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Don’t be absurd</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it’s simply wicked to talk like that. How do I know what       you are doing? As if I can leave you for an hour in uncertainty! Your       face! If you don’t open at once I shall believe there’s something       seriously wrong: I shall send Ada for assistance.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘If you do that</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it will be disastrous.

I shall wait in the next room until you call.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Wait where you please</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ Lawford replied</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘but tell them downstairs.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Then if I tell them to wait until half-past eight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you will come down?       You say you are not ill: the dinner will be ruined. It’s absurd.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford made no answer. He listened a while</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then he deliberately sat down       once more to try to think. Like a squirrel in a cage his mind seemed to be       aimlessly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unceasingly astir. ‘What is it really? What is it really?—really?’        He sat there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it seemed to him his body was transparent as glass. It       seemed he had no body at all—only the memory of an hallucinatory       reflection in the glass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this inward voice crying</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">arguing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">questioning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">threatening out of the silence—‘What is it really—really—REALLY?’        And at last</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wearied out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he rose once more</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">leaned between the       two long candle-flames</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stared on—on—on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">into the glass.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He gave that long</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dark face that had been foisted on him tricks to do—lift       an eyebrow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">frown. There was scarcely any perceptible pause between the       wish</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its performance. He found to his discomfiture that the face       answered instantaneously to the slightest emotion</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even to his fainter       secondary thoughts</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if these unfamiliar features were not entirely       within control. He could not</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in fact</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">without the glass before him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tell       precisely what that face WAS expressing. He was still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it seemed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">keenly       sane. That he would discover for certain when Sheila returned. Terror</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rage</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">horror had fallen back. If only he felt ill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or was in pain: he       would have rejoiced at it. He was simply caught in some unheard-of snare—caught</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how? when? where? by whom?     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;a name=&quot;link2HCH0002&quot; id=&quot;link2HCH0002&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div style=&quot;height: 4em</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">&quot;&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;       CHAPTER TWO     &lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       But the coolness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">deliberation of his scrutiny</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had to a certain extent       calmed Lawford’s mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">given him confidence. Hitherto he had met the       little difficulties of life only to vanquish them with ease</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">applause.       Now he was standing face to face with the unknown. He burst out laughing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">into a long</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">low</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">helpless laughter. Then he arose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">began to walk       softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">swiftly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fro across the room—from wall to wall seven       paces</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at the fourth</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that awful</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unseen</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">brightly-lit profile passed       as swiftly over the tranquil surface of the looking-glass. The power of       concentration was gone again. He simply paced on mechanically</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listening       to a Babel of questions</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a conflicting medley of answers. But above all       the confusion</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turmoil of his brain</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as a boatswain’s whistle rises       above a storm</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so sounded that same infinitesimal voice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">incessantly       repeating another question now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘What are you going to do? What are you       going to do?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       And in the midst of this confusion</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">out of the infinite</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as it were</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">came       another sharp tap at the door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">all within sank to utter stillness       again.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘It’s nearly half-past eight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Arthur</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I can’t wait any longer.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford cast a last fleeting look into the glass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">confronted       the closed door. ‘Very well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you shall not wait any longer.’ He       crossed over to the door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">suddenly a swift crafty idea flashed into       his mind.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He tapped on the panel. ‘Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I want you first</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">before you come in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to get me something out of my old writing-desk in the       smoking-room. Here is the key.’ He pushed a tiny key—from off the       ring he carried—beneath the door. ‘In the third little drawer from       the top</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on the left side</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">is a letter</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">please don’t say anything now.

You scribbled in the corner under your signature the initials       “<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Y.S.O.A.</abbr>”—do you remember? They meant</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">You Silly Old Arthur!—do       you remember? Will you please get that letter at once?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Arthur</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ answered the voice from without</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">empty of all expression</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘what       does all this mean</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this mystery</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this hopeless nonsense about a silly       letter? What has happened? Is this a miserable form of persecution? Are       you mad?—I refuse to get the letter.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford stooped</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">black</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">angular</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">against the door. ‘I am not mad.

You must get the letter</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if only for       your own peace of mind.’ He heard his wife hesitate as she turned. He       heard a sob. And once more he waited.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I have brought the letter</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ came the low toneless voice again.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Have you opened it?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       There was a rustle of paper. ‘Are the letters there underlined three times—“<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Y.S.O.A.</abbr>”?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘The letters are there.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘And the date of the month is underneath</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">“April 3rd.” No one else in the       whole world</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">living or dead</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">could know of this but ourselves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Will you please open the door?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘No one?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I suppose not—no one.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Then come in.’ He unlocked the door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">opened it. A dark</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rather       handsome woman</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with sleek hair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in a silk dress of a dark rich colour       entered. Lawford closed the door. But his face was in shadow. He had still       a moment’s respite.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I need not ask you to be patient</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he began quickly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘if I could possibly       have spared you—if there had been anybody in the world to go to... I       am in horrible</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">horrible trouble</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila. It is inconceivable.

Would you mind looking?’ He walked slowly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with face       averted towards the dressing-table.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Simply a nervous—to make such a fuss</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to scare!...’ began his wife</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">following him.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Without a word he took up the two old china candlesticks</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">held them</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">one in each lank-fingered hand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">before his face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford could see his wife—every tint</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">curve</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">line as       distinctly as she could see him. Her cheeks never had much colour</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">now her       whole face visibly darkened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">from pallor to a dusky leaden grey</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as she       gazed. It was not an illusion then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not a miserable hallucination. The       unbelievable</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the inconceivable</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had happened. He replaced the candles       with trembling fingers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sat down.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘what is it really</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">what is it really</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila? What on       earth are we to do?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Is the door locked?’ she whispered. He nodded. With eyes fixed stirlessly       on his face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila unsteadily seated herself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a little out of the       candlelight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the shadow. Lawford rose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">put the key of the door on       his wife’s little rose-wood prayer-desk at her elbow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">deliberately sat       down again.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You said “a fit”—where?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I suppose—is—is it very different—hopeless? You will       understand my being... O Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">what am I to do?’ His wife sat perfectly       still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">watching him with unflinching attention.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You gave me to understand—“a nervous fit”</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">where?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford took a deep breath</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quietly faced her again. ‘In the old       churchyard</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Widderstone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I was looking at—at the gravestones.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘A fit</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the old churchyard</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Widderstone—you were “looking at the       gravestones”?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford shut his mouth. ‘I suppose so—a fit</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said presently. ‘My       heart went a little queer</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I sat down</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fell into a kind of doze—a       stupor</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I suppose.

Whoever you are</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">whoever you may be</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">is it likely? I am not in the least       afraid.

He heard her softly       crying</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he heard the bed shaken with her sobs. But a slow glance towards       the steady candle-flames restrained him. He let her cry on alone. When she       had become a little more composed he stood up. ‘You have had no dinner</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’        he managed to blurt out at last</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘you will be faint.

She took the key out of the lock</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">placed it on the bed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with a sigh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that was not quite without a hint of relief in its       misery</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she furtively extinguished the gas-light on the landing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rustled downstairs.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She speedily returned. ‘I have brought the book.’ she said hastily. ‘I       could only find the one volume. I have said you have taken a fresh chill.       No one will disturb you.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford took the book without a word. And once more</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with eyes stonily       averted</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his wife left him to his own company</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that of the face in the       glass.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       When completely deserted</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford with fumbling fingers opened Quain’s       ‘Dictionary of Medicine.’ He had never had much curiosity</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had always       hated what he disbelieved</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but none the less he had heard occasionally of       absurd</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">questionable experiments.

Then suddenly recollecting himself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he paused</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listened. There       came a tap on the door. ‘Is that you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila?’ he called</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">doubtfully.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘No</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it’s me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ came the answer.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">don’t trouble</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I only wanted to speak to your mistress.

Mr Critchett was in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then? Thank you. Extreme</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">extreme silence</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">please.’ Again that knotted</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">melodramatic finger raised itself on high</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">within that lean</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cadaverous body the soul of its lodger quailed at       this spectral boldness. But it was triumphant. The maid at once left him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">went downstairs. He heard faint voices in muffled consultation. And in       a moment Sheila’s silks rustled once more on the staircase. Lawford put       down the lamp</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">watched her deliberately close the door.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What does this mean?’ she began swiftly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I understand that—Ada       tells me a stranger is here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">giving orders</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">directions. Who is he? where       is he? You bound yourself on your solemn promise not to stir till I       returned. You... How can I</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how can we get decently through this horrible       business if you are so wretchedly indiscreet? You sent Ada to the       chemist’s. What for? What for? I say.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford watched his wife with an almost extraneous interest. She was       certainly extremely interesting from that point of view</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that very novel       point of view. ‘It’s quite useless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘to get in the least nervous       or hysterical. I don’t care for the darkness just now. That was all. Tell       the girl I am a strange doctor—Dr Simon’s new partner. You are       clever at conventionalities</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila. Invent! I said our patient must be       kept quiet—I really think he must. That is all</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so far as Ada is       concerned.... What on earth else ARE we to say?’ he broke out. ‘That</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for       the present to EVERYBODY</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">is our only possible story. It will give us what       we must have—time. And next—where is the second volume of       Quain? I want that. And next—why have you broken faith with me?’ Mrs       Lawford sat down. This sudden</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">baffling outburst had stupefied her.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I can’t</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I can’t make head or tail of what you say.

Mr Bethany will be perfectly discreet—if he thinks       discretion desirable. He is the only available friend we have close enough       to ask at once. And things of this kind are</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I suppose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if anybody’s       concern</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his. It’s certain to leak out. Everybody will hear of it. Don’t       flatter yourself you are going to hush up a thing like this for long. You       can’t keep living skeletons in a cupboard. You think only of yourself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only of your own misfortune. But who’s to know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pray</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that you really are       my husband—if you are? The sooner I get the vicar on my side the       better for us both. Who in the whole of the parish—I ask you—and       you must have the sense left to see that—who will believe that a       respectable man</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a gentleman</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a Churchman</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">would deliberately go out to       seek an afternoon’s amusement in a poky little country churchyard? Why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">apart from everything else</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">THAT was absolutely mad to start with. Can you       really wonder at the result?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Probably because she still steadfastly refused to look at him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her memory       kept losing its hold on the appalling fact facing them. She realised fully       only that she was in a great</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unwarrantable</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">insurmountable       difficulty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but until she actually lifted her eyes for a moment she had       not fully realised what that difficulty was. She got up with a sudden</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">horrible nausea. ‘One moment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I will see if the servants have       gone to bed.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       That long saturnine face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">behind which Lawford lay in a dull</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">desperate       ambush</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">smiled. Something partaking of its clay</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">some reflex ghost of its       rather remarkable features</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was even a little amused at Sheila.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She returned in a moment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stood in profile in the doorway. ‘Will you       come down?’ she remarked distantly.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘One moment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ Lawford began miserably. ‘Before we take this       irrevocable step</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a step I implore you to postpone awhile—for what       comes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I suppose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">may go—what precisely have you told the vicar? I       must in fairness know that.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘In fairness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she began ironically</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">suddenly broke off. Her husband       had turned the flame of the lamp low down in the vacant room behind them</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the corridor was lit obscurely by the chandelier far down in the hall       below. A faint</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">inexplicable dread fell softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">coldly on her heart.       ‘Have you no trust in me?’ she murmured a little bitterly. ‘I have simply       told him the truth.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       They softly descended the stairs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she first</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the dark figure following       close behind her.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;a name=&quot;link2HCH0003&quot; id=&quot;link2HCH0003&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div style=&quot;height: 4em</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">&quot;&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;       CHAPTER THREE     &lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mr Bethany sat awaiting them in the dining-room</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a large</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">heavily-furnished room with a great benign looking-glass on the       mantelpiece</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a marble clock</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with rich old damask curtains. Fleecy       silver hair was all that was visible of their visitor when they entered.       But Mr Bethany rose out of his chair when he heard them</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with a little       jerk</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned sharply round. Thus it was that the gold-spectacled vicar</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford first confronted each other</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the one brightly illuminated</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the       other framed in the gloom of the doorway. Mr Bethany’s first scrutiny was       timid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">courteous</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but beneath it he tried to be keen</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">himself       hastened round the table almost at a trot</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to obtain</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as delicately as       possible</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a closer view. But Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">having shut the door behind him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had       gone straight to the fire</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">seated himself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">leaning his face in his       hands. Mr Bethany smiled faintly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">waved his hand almost as if in blessing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but certainly in peace</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tapped Mrs Lawford into the chair upon the       other side. But he himself remained standing.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Mrs Lawford has</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I declare</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">been telling family secrets</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he began</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">paused</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">peering. But there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you will forgive an old friend’s intrusion—this       little confidence about a change</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my dear fellow—about a ramble</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a change?’ He sat down</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">put up his kind little puckered face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">peered       again at Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then very hastily at his wife. But all her attention       was centred on the bowed figure opposite to her. Lawford responded to this       cautious advance without raising his head.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You do not wish me to repeat all that my wife tells me she has told you?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Dear me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Mr Bethany cheerfully</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I wish nothing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">nothing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">old       friend. You must not burden yourself with me. If I may be of any help</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">here I am.... Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no....’ he paused</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with blinking eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but wits       still shrewd</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">alert. Why doesn’t the man raise his head? he thought. A       mere domestic dispute!     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he went on ruminatingly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I thought on Tuesday</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on       Tuesday</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that you weren’t looking quite the thing. Indeed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I remarked on       it. But now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I understand from Mrs Lawford that the malady has taken a       graver turn—eh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">an heretical turn? I hear you have been       wandering from the true fold.’ Mr Bethany leaned forward with what might       be described as a very large smile in a very small compass. ‘And that</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of       course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">entailed instant retribution.’ He broke off solemnly. ‘I know       Widderstone churchyard well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a most verdant</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beautiful spot. The late       rector</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a Mr Strickland</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was a very old friend of mine. And his wife</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear       good Alicia</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">used to set out her babies</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the morning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to sleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to       play there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">twenty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps twenty-five years ago.

He is looking at       you!’ He stopped</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">faltered</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a slight warmth came into his face. ‘And</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you were taken ill there?’ His voice had fallen flat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">faint.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I fell asleep—or something of that sort</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ came the stubborn reply.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Mr Bethany</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">brightly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘so your wife was saying. “Fell asleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">”        so have I too—scores of times’</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he beamed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with beads of sweat       glistening on his forehead. ‘And then? I’m not</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I’m not persisting?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Then I woke</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">refreshed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as it seemed—I felt much better</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">came home.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Ah</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said his visitor. And after that there was a long</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">brightly       lit</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">intense pause</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at the end of which Lawford raised his face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">again       looked firmly at his friend.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mr Bethany was now a shrunken old man</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he sat perfectly still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his head       craned a little forward</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his veined hands clutching his bent</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">spare       knees.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       There wasn’t the least sign of devilry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or out-facingness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or insolence in       that lean shadowy steady head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet he himself was compelled to sidle       his glance away</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so much the face shook him. He closed his eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">too</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as a       cat does after exchanging too direct a scrutiny with human eyes. He put       out towards</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">withdrew</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a groping hand from Mrs Lawford.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Is it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ came a voice from somewhere</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘is it a great change</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir?

His lips moved as if he were talking to himself. And again it was       Lawford’s faltering voice that broke the silence. ‘You see</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I       have never... no fit</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or anything of that kind before. I remember on       Tuesday... oh yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quite well. I did feel seedy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very. And we talked</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">didn’t we?—Harvest Festival</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Mrs Wine’s flowers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the new       offertory-bags</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">all that. For God’s sake</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Vicar</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it is not as bad as—as       they make out?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mr Bethany woke with a start. He leaned forward</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stretched out a long       black wrinkled sleeve</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just managing to reach far enough to tap Lawford’s       knee. ‘Don’t worry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">don’t worry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said soothingly. ‘We believe</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">we       believe.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It was</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">none the less</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a sheer act of faith.

Facing me there were some cypress-trees</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beyond</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a low sunken fence</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just open country.

And then very quietly he stole one mole-like look       into his sidesman’s face.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What is Dr Simon’s number?’ he said. Lawford was gazing gloomily into the       fire. ‘Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Annandale</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he replied absently. ‘I don’t know the number.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Do you believe in him? Your wife mentioned him.

If once I forget</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">who will believe me?’ He thrust his       long lean fingers beneath his coat. ‘And mad</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he added</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I would sooner       die.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mr Bethany deliberately adjusted his spectacles. ‘May I</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">may I       experiment?’ he said boldly. There came a tap on the door.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Bless me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said the vicar</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">taking out his watch</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘it is a quarter to       twelve. ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Mrs Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he trotted round to the door. ‘We are       beginning to see light—a ray!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘But I—I can see in the dark</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ whispered Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if at a cue</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turning with an inscrutable smile to the fire.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The vicar came again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wrapped up in a little tight grey great-coat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a       white silk muffler.

You will forgive me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She looked up swiftly. ‘It’s very tiresome</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I can’t find anywhere</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she       murmured</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I can’t find anywhere the—the little red box key.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford’s cheek turned more sallow than ever. ‘You are only pretending to       look for it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘to try me. We both know perfectly well the lock is       broken. Ada broke it.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Sheila let fall the lid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet for a while her eyes roved over it as if       in violent search for something. Then she turned: ‘I am so very glad the       vicar was at home</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said brightly. ‘And mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">mind you rest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Arthur.       There’s nothing so bad but it might be worse.... Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I can’t</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I can’t bear       it!’ She sat down in the chair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">huddled her face between her hands</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sobbing on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">without a tear.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford listened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stared solemnly. ‘Whatever it may be</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I will       be loyal</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Her sobs hushed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">again cold horror crept over her. Nobody in the whole       world could have said that ‘I will be loyal’ quite like that—nobody       but Arthur. She stood up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">patting her hair. ‘I don’t think my brain would       bear much more. It’s useless to talk.

Faint</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">solitary pictures broke the blankness of each wall. The carpet was rich</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the bed impressive</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the basins on the washstand as uninviting as the       bed. Lawford sat down on the edge of it in complete isolation. He sat       without stirring</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listening to his watch ticking in his pocket. The china       clock on the chimney piece pointed cheerfully to the hour of dawn. It was       exactly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he computed carefully</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">five hours</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">seven minutes fast. Not the       slightest sound broke the stillness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">until he heard</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gradually</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the key of his door turn in the oiled wards</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">realized that       he was a prisoner.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Women were strange creatures. How often he had heard that said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he thought       lamely. He felt no anger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no surprise or resentment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at the trick. It was       only to be expected. He could sit on till morning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">easily till morning. He       had never noticed before how empty a well-furnished room could seem. It       was his own room too</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his best visitors’ room. His father-in-law had slept       here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with his whiskers on that pillow. His wife’s most formidable aunt       had been all night here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">alone with these pictures. She certainly was...       ‘But what are you doing here?’ cried a voice suddenly out of his reverie.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He started up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stretched himself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">taking out the neat little packet       that the maid had brought from the chemist’s</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he drew up a chair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sat       down once more in front of the glass. He sighed vacantly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lifted       down from the wall above the fireplace a tinted photograph of himself that       Sheila had had enlarged about twelve years ago. It was a brighter</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">younger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hairier</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but unmistakably the same dull indolent Lawford who had       ventured into Widderstone churchyard that afternoon. The cheek was a       little plumper</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the eyes not quite so full-lidded</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the hair a little more       precisely parted</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the upper lip graced with a small blonde moustache. He       tilted the portrait into the candlelight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">compared it with this       reflection in the glass of what had come out of Widderstone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">feature with       feature</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with perfect composure</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">extreme care</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Then he laid down the       massive frame on the table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gazed quietly at the tiny packet.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It was to be a day of queer experiences. He had never before realized with       how many miracles mere everyday life is besieged. Here in this small       punctilious packet lay a Sesame—a power of transformation beside       which the transformation of that rather flaccid face of the noonday into       this tense</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sinister face of midnight was but as a moving from house to       house—a change just as irrevocable</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">complete</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet so very       normal. Which should it be</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or—his face lifted itself once       more to the ice-like gloom of the looking-glass-that</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or this?     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It simply gazed back with a kind of quizzical pity on its lean features       under the scrutiny of eyes so deep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so meaningful</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so desolate</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet so       indomitably courageous. In the brain behind them a slow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stolid       argument was in progress</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the one baffling reply on the one side to every       appeal on the other being still simply. ‘What dreams may come?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Those eyes surely knew something of dreams</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">else</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">why this violent</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stubborn endeavour to keep awake.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford did indeed once actually frame the question</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘But who the devil       are you?’ And it really seemed the eyes perceptibly widened or brightened.       The mere vexation of his unparalleled position. Sheila’s pathetic       incredulity</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his old vicar’s laborious kindness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the tiresome network of       experience into which he would be dragged struggling on the morrow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on       the morrow after that</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">after that—the thought of all these       things faded for the moment from his mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lost if not their significance</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at least their instancy.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He simply sat face to face with the sheer difficulty of living on at all.       He even concluded in a kind of lethargy that if nothing had occurred</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no       ‘change</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he might still be sitting here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Arthur Rennet Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in his       best visitor’s room</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">deciding between inscrutable life</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just—death.       He supposed he was tired out. His thoughts hadn’t even the energy to       complete themselves. None cared but himself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this—this Silence.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘But what does it all mean?’ the insistent voice he was getting to know so       well began tediously inquiring again. And every time he raised his eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rather</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as in many cases it seemed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his eyes raised themselves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">they       saw this haunting face there—a face he no longer bitterly rebelled       at</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">nor dimmed with scrutiny</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but a face that was becoming a kind of hold       on life</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even a kind of refuge</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">an ally. It was a face that might have       come out of a rather flashy book</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or such as is revered on the stage. ‘A       rotten bad face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he whispered at it in his own familiar slang</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">after some       such abrupt encounter</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a fearless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">packed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">daring</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fascinating face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with       even—what?—a spice of genius in it. Whose the devil’s face was       it? What on earth was the matter?... ‘Brazen it out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ a jubilant thought       cried suddenly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘follow it up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">play the game! give me just one opening.       Think—think what I’ve risked!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       And all these voices thought Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in deadly lassitude</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">meant only one       thing—insanity. A blazing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">impotent indignation seized him. He       leaned near</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">peering as it were out of a red dusky mist. He snatched up       the china candlestick</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">poised it above the sardonic reflection</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if       to throw. Then slowly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with infinite pains</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he drew back from the glass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">replaced the candlestick on the table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stuffed his paper packet into       his pocket</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">took off his boots</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">threw himself on to the bed. In a       little while</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the faint</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">still light</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he opened drowsily wondering       eyes. `Poor old thing!’ his voice murmured</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘Poor old Sheila!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;a name=&quot;link2HCH0005&quot; id=&quot;link2HCH0005&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div style=&quot;height: 4em</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">&quot;&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;       CHAPTER FIVE     &lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It was but little after daybreak when Mrs Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">after listening at his       door a while</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned the key</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looked in on her husband. Blue-grey light       from between the venetian blinds just dusked the room. She stood in a       bluish dressing-gown</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her hand on her bosom</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looking down on the lean       impassive face. For the briefest instant her heart had leapt with an       indescribable surmise</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to fall dull as lead once more. Breathing equably</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quietly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the strange figure lay stretched upon the bed. ‘How can he       sleep? How can he sleep?’ she whispered with a black</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hopeless       indignation. What a night she had had! And he!     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She turned noiselessly away. The candle had guttered to extinction. The       big glass reflected her</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">voluminous</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wan</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her dark-ringed eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">full       lips</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rich</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">glossy hair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rounded chin. ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ it seemed to murmur       mournfully. She turned away</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drawing stealthily near stooped once more       quite low</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">examined the face on the pillow with lynx-like       concentration. And though every nerve revolted at the thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she was       finally convinced</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unwillingly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but assuredly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that her husband was here.       Indeed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if it were not so</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how could she for a single moment have accepted       the possibility that he was a stranger? He seemed to haunt</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a ghostly       emanation</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this strange</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">detestable face—as memory supplies the       features concealed beneath a mask. The face was still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stony</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like one       dead or imaged in wax</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet beneath it dreams were passing—silly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ordinary Lawford dreams. She was almost alarmed at the terribly rancorous       hatred she felt for the face... ‘It was just like Arthur to be so taken       in!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Then she too remembered Quain</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">remembered also in the slowly paling       dusk that the house would soon be stirring. She went out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">noiselessly       locked the door again. But it was useless to begin looking for Quain now—her       husband had a good many dull books</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">most of them his ‘eccentric’ father’s.       What must the servants be thinking?</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">what was all that talk about a       mysterious visitor? She would have to question Ada—diplomatically.       She returned to her room</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sat down in an arm-chair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">waited. In       sheer weariness she fell into a doze</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">woke at the sound of dustpan</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">broom. She rang the bell</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">asked for hot water</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tea</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a basin of       cornflour.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘And please</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Ada</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">be as quiet as possible over your work</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">your master is       in a nice sleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">must not be disturbed on any account. In the front       bedroom.’ She looked up suddenly. ‘By the way</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">who let Dr Ferguson in last       night?’ It was dangerous</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but successful.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Dr Ferguson</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ma’am? Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you mean... He WAS in.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Sheila smiled resignedly. ‘Was in? What do you mean</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">“was in”? And where       were you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I had been sent out to Critchett’s</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the chemist’s.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of course. So cook let Dr Ferguson in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then? Why didn’t you       say so before</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Ada? And did you bring the medicine with you?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘It was a packet in an envelope</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ma’am. But Cook is sure she heard no       knock—not while I was out. So Dr Ferguson must have come in quite       unbeknown.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">really</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘it seems very difficult to get at the truth       sometimes. And when illness is in the house I cannot understand why there       should be no one available to answer the door. You must have left it ajar</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unsecured</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">when you went out.

He put his       hand to his head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘es</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it’s a rattling good move.       I’m not quite awake</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">myself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I mean. I’ll do it now.’ He took out a pencil       case</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tore another leaf from his pocket-book. ‘What are they?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mr Bethany rang the bell. Sheila herself answered it. She stood on the       threshold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looked across through a shaft of autumnal sunshine at her       husband</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her husband with a quiet strange smile looked across through       the sunshine at his wife. Mr Bethany waited in vain.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I am just going to put the arch-impostor through his credentials</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he       said tartly. ‘Now then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford!’ He read out the questions</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">one by one</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">from his crafty little list</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pursing his lips between each</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">one by       one</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">seated at the dressing-table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fluently scribbled his       answers. Then question</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">answer were rigorously compared by Mr Bethany</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with small white head bent close</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">spectacles poised upon the powerful       nose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">signed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dated</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">passed to Mrs Lawford without a word.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mrs Lawford read question</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">answer where she stood</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in complete silence.       She looked up. ‘Many of these questions I don’t know the answers to       myself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘It is immaterial</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Mr Bethany.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘One answer is—is inaccurate. ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quite so: due to a mistake       in a letter from myself.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mrs Lawford read quietly on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">folded the papers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">held them out between       finger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">thumb. ‘The—handwriting...’ she remarked very softly.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Wonderful</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">isn’t it?’ said Mr Bethany warmly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘all the general look</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">run of the thing different</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but every real essential feature unchanged.       Now into the envelope. And now a little wax?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mrs Lawford stood waiting. ‘There’s a green piece of sealing-wax</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ almost       drawled the quiet voice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘in the top right drawer of the nest in the       study</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">which old James gave me the Christmas before last.’ He glanced with       lowered eyelids at his wife’s flushed cheek. Their eyes met.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Thank you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       When she returned the vicar was sitting in a chair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">leaning his chin on       the knobbed handle of his umbrella. He rose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lit a taper for her with a       match from a little green pot on the table. And Mrs Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with       trembling fingers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sealed the letter</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he directed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with his own seal.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘There!’ he said triumphantly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘how many more such brilliant lawyers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I       wonder</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lie dormant in the Church? And who shall keep this?... Why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">all       three</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of course.’ He went on without pausing. ‘Some little drawer now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">secret</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">undetectable</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with a lock.’ Just such a little drawer that       locked itself with a spring lay by chance in the looking-glass. There the       letter was hidden. And Mr Bethany looked at his watch. ‘Nineteen minutes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’        he said. ‘The next thing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my dear child—we’re getting on swimmingly—and       it’s astonishing how things are simplified by mere use—the next       thing is to send for Simon.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Sheila took a deep breath</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but did not look up. ‘I am entirely in your       hands</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she replied.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘So be it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said he crisply. ‘Get to bed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it’s better so. And       I’ll look in on my way back from Witchett. I came</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my dear fellow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in       gloomy disturbance of mind. It was getting up too early</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it fogs old       brains. Good-bye</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">good-bye.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He squeezed Lawford’s hand. Then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with umbrella under his arm</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his hat on       his head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his spectacles readjusted</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he hurried out of the room. Mrs       Lawford followed him. For a few minutes Lawford sat motionless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with head       bent a little</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">eyes restlessly scanning the door. Then he rose       abruptly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in a quarter of an hour was in bed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">alone with his slow       thoughts: while a basin of cornflour stood untasted on a little table at       his bedside</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a cheerful fire burned in the best visitors’ room’s tiny       grate.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       At half-past eleven Dr Simon entered this soundless seclusion. He sat down       beside Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">took temperature</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pulse. Then he half closed his       lids</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">scanned his patient out of an unusually dark</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">un-English face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with straight black hair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listened attentively to his rather       incoherent story. It was a story very much modified</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rounded off. Nor       did Lawford draw Dr Simon’s attention to the portrait now smiling       conventionally above their heads from the wall over the fireplace.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘It was rather bleak—the wind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">and</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I had had a       touch of influenza. It was a silly thing to do. But still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Dr Simon</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">one       doesn’t expect—well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I don’t feel the same man—physically.       I really cannot explain how great a change has taken place. And yet I feel       perfectly fit in myself. And if it were not for—for being laughed       at</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">go back to town</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to-day. Why my wife scarcely recognised me.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Dr Simon continued his scrutiny. Try as he would</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford could not raise       his downcast eyes to meet direct the doctor’s polite attention.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘And what</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Dr Simon</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘what precisely is the nature of the change?       Have you any pain?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘No</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not the least pain</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or rather my       face is a little shrunken—and yet lengthened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at least it feels so</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a faint twinge of rheumatism. But my hair—well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I don’t know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it’s difficult to say one’s self.’ He could get on so very much better</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he       thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if only his mind would be at peace</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">these preposterous       promptings</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">voices were still.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Dr Simon faced the window</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drew his hand softly over his head. ‘We       never can be too cautious at a certain age</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">especially after       influenza</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said. ‘It undermines the whole system</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in particular       the nervous system</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">leaving the mind the prey of the most melancholy       fancies. I should astound you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Mr Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with the devil influenza       plays.... A slight nervous shock</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a chill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quite slight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I hope. A few       days’ rest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">plenty of nourishment. There’s nothing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">temperature       inconsiderable. All perfectly intelligible. Most certainly reassure       yourself! And as for the change you speak of’—he looked steadily at       the dark face on the pillow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">smiled amiably—‘I don’t think we       need worry much about that. It certainly was a bleak wind yesterday—and       a cemetery</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my dear sir! It was indiscreet—yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very.’ He held out       his hand. ‘You must not be alarmed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very distinctly with the       merest trace of an accent</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘air</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sunshine</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">nourishment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sleep—that       is all. The little window might be a few inches open</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">and—and any       light reading.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He opened the door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">joined Mrs Lawford on the staircase. He talked to       her quietly over his shoulder all the way downstairs. ‘It was</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it was       sporting with Providence—a wind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">believe me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">nearly due east</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in       spite of the warm sunshine.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘But the change—the change!’ Mrs Lawford managed to murmur       tragically</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he strode to the door. Dr Simon smiled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gracefully       tapped his forehead with a red-gloved forefinger.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Humour him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">humour him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he repeated indulgently. ‘Rest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quiet will       soon put that little trouble out of his head. Oh yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I did notice it—the       set drawn look</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the droop: quite so. Good morning.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mrs Lawford gently closed the door after him. A glimpse of Ada</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">crossing       from room to room</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">suggested a precaution. She called out in her clearest       notes. ‘If Dr Ferguson should call while I am out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Ada</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">will you please       tell him that Dr Simon regretted that he was unable to wait? Thank you.’        She paused with hand on the balusters</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then slowly ascended the stairs.       Her husband’s face was turned to the ceiling</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his hands clasped above his       head. She took up her stand by the fireplace</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">resting one silk-slippered       foot on the fender. ‘Dr Simon is reassuring</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘but I do hope</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Arthur</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you will follow his advice. He looks a fairly clever man.... But       with a big practice.... Do you think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he quite realised the extent       of the—the change?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I told him what happened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said her husband’s voice out of the       bed-clothes.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Sheila soothingly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘but we must remember he is       comparatively a stranger. He would not detect—’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What did he tell you?’ asked the voice.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mrs Lawford deliberately considered. If only he would always thus keep his       face concealed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how much easier it would be to discuss matters rationally.       ‘You see</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">nothing about the       nerves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but personally</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I think his suggestion absurd.

Why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I read once of a fellow in India</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a       Hindoo</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or something</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">who—’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘But have you HAD any intense strain</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or anxiety?’ broke in Sheila. ‘You       might</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at least</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">have confided in me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that is</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unless—But there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">don’t you think really</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Arthur</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it would be much more satisfactory in       every way if we had further advice at once?

We must</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as the poor dear old vicar said only last night</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">keep our heads clear.

Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">anything on earth but this dreadful wearing uncertainty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">suspense! Besides ...is Simon quite an English name?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford drew further into his pillow. ‘Do as you think best</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he       said. ‘For my own part</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I believe it may be as he suggests—partly an       illusion</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a touch of nervous breakdown.

And if not—well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you shall not       suffer</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila. Don’t be afraid. There are other ways out.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Sheila broke down. ‘Any one would think to hear you talk</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that I was       perfectly heartless.

The servants</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">all who inquire shall simply be told that my       husband is confined to his room with—with a nervous breakdown</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as       you have yourself so glibly suggested. I am at your mercy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I own it. The       vicar believes your preposterous story—with his spectacles off.

That is all I have to say. To-night I tell the vicar all that I have just       told you. And from this moment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">please</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">we are strangers. I shall come       into the room no more than necessity dictates. On Friday we resume our       real parts. My husband—Arthur—to—to connive at... Phh!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Rage had transfigured her. She scarcely heard her own words. They poured       out senselessly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">monotonously</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">one calling up another</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if from the lips       of a Cassandra. Lawford sank back into bed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">clutching the sheets with both       lean hands. He took a deep breath</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shut his mouth.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘It reminds me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he began arduously</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘of our first quarrel before       we were married</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the evening after your aunt Rose died at Llandudno—do       you remember?

Then a queer</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">almost inarticulate voice added</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘At least</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I am afraid so.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       A cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">awful quietness fell on Sheila’s heart. She stared fixedly at       the tuft of dark hair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the only visible sign of her husband</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on the       pillow. Then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">taking up the basin of cold cornflour</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she left the room. In       a quarter of an hour she reappeared carrying a tray</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with ham</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">eggs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">coffee</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">honey invitingly displayed. She laid it down.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘There is only one other question</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with perfect composure—‘that       of money.

I have my own       cheque-book</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shall therefore have no need to consider the question       again for—for the present. So far as you are concerned</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I shall be       guided solely by Mr Bethany. He will</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I do not doubt</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">take full       responsibility.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘And may the Lord have mercy on my soul!’ uttered a stifled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unfamiliar       voice from the bed. Mrs Lawford stooped. ‘Arthur!’ she cried faintly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘Arthur!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford raised himself on his elbow with a sigh that was very near to       being a sob. ‘Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if you’d only be your real self! What is the use       of all this pretence? Just consider MY position a little. The fear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">horror are not all on your side. You called me Arthur even then. I’d       willingly do anything you wish to save you pain</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you know that. Can’t we       be friends even in this—this ghastly—Won’t you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Mrs Lawford drew back</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">struggling with a doubtful heart.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">`it would be better not to discuss that now.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The rest of the morning Lawford remained in solitude.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;a name=&quot;link2HCH0006&quot; id=&quot;link2HCH0006&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div style=&quot;height: 4em</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">&quot;&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;       CHAPTER SIX     &lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       There were three books in the room—Jeremy Taylor’s ‘Holy Living</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Dying</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ a volume of the Quiver</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a little gilded book on wildflowers.       He read in vain. He lay</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listened to the uproar of his thoughts on       which an occasional sound—the droning of a fly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the cry of a       milkman</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the noise of a passing van—obtruded from the workaday       world. The pale gold sunlight edged softly over the bed. He ate up       everything on his tray. He even</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on the shoals of nightmare</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dreamed       awhile. But by</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">by as the hours wheeled slowly on he grew less calm</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">less strenuously resolved on lying there inactive. Every sparrow that       twittered cried reveille through his brain. He longed with an ardour       strange to his temperament to be up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">doing.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       What if his misfortune was</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he had in the excitement of the moment       suggested to Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only a morbid delusion of mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shared too in part by       sheer force of his absurd confession? Even if he was going mad</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">who knows       how peaceful a release that might not be? Could his shrewd old vicar have       implicitly believed in him if the change were as complete as he supposed       it? He flung off the bedclothes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">locked the door. He dressed himself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">noticing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he fancied</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with a deadly revulsion of feeling</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that his coat       was a little too short in the sleeves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his waistcoat too loose. In the       midst of his dressing came Sheila bringing his luncheon. ‘I’m sorry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he       called out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stooping quickly beside the bed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I can’t talk now. Please put       the tray down.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       About half an hour afterwards he heard the outer door close</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">peeping       from behind the curtains saw his wife go out. All was drowsily quiet in       the house. He devoured his lunch like a schoolboy. That finished to the       last crumb</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">without a moment’s delay he covered his face with a towel</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">locked the door behind him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">put the key in his pocket</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ran lightly       downstairs. He stuffed the towel into an ulster pocket</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">put on a soft</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wide-brimmed hat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">noiselessly let himself out. Then he turned with an       almost hysterical delight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ran—ran like the wind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">without       pausing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">without thinking</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">straight on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">up one turning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">down another</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">until he reached a broad open common</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">thickly wooded</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sprinkled with gorse</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hazel</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">may</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">faintly purple with fading heather. There he flung       himself down in the beautiful sunlight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">among the yellowing bracken</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to       recover his breath.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He lay there for many minutes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">thinking almost with composure. Flight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it       seemed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had for the moment quietened the demands of that other feebly       struggling personality which was beginning to insinuate itself into his       consciousness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">which had so miraculously broken in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">taken possession of       his body. He would not think now. All he needed was a little quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">patience before he threw off for good</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">all his right to be free</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to be       his own master</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to call himself sane.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He scrambled up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned his face towards the westering sun. What was       there in the stillness of its beautiful splendour that seemed to sharpen       his horror</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">difficulty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet to stir him to such a daring</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">devilry as he had never known since he was a boy? There was little sound       of life</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">somewhere an unknown bird was singing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a few late bees were       droning in the bracken. All these years he had</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like an old blind horse</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stolidly plodded round</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">round in a dull self-set routine. And now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just       when the spirit had come for rebellion</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the mood for a harmless truancy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there had fallen with them too this hideous enigma. He sat there with the       dusky silhouette of the face that was now drenched with sunlight in his       mind’s eye. He set off again up the stony incline.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Why not walk on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on? In time real wholesome weariness would come</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he       could sleep at ease in some pleasant wayside inn</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">without once meeting the       eyes that stood as it were like a window between himself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a shrewd       incredulous scoffing world that would turn him into a monstrosity</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his       story into a fable. And in a little while</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps in three days</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he would       awaken out of this engrossing nightmare</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">know he was free</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this black       dog gone from his back</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his own man again. How astonished       Sheila would be</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how warmly she would welcome him!... Oh yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of course       she would.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He came again to a standstill. No voice answered him out of that       illimitable gold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">blue. Nothing seemed aware of him. But as he stood       there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">doubtful as Cain on the outskirts of the unknown</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he caught the       sound of a footfall on the lonely</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stone-strewn path.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The ground sloped steeply away to the left</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">slowly mounting the       hillside came mildly on an old lady he knew</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a Miss Sinnet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">an old friend       of his mother’s. There was just such a little seat as that other he knew       so well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on the brow of the hill. He made his way to it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">intending to sit       quietly there until the little old lady had passed by. Up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">up she came.       Her large bonnet appeared</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then her mild white face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">inclined a little       towards him as she ascended. Evidently this very seat was her goal</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">evasion was impossible. Evasion!... Memory rushed back</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">set his pulses       beating. He turned boldly to the sun</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the old lady</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with a brief       glance into his face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">composed herself at the other end of the little       seat. She gazed out of a gentle reverie into the golden valley. And so       they sat a while. And almost as if she had felt the bond of acquaintance       between them</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she presently sighed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">addressed him: ‘A very</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beautiful view</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford paused</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then turned a gloomy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">earnest face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gilded with sunshine.       ‘Beautiful</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">indeed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘but not for me. No</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Miss Sinnet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not for       me.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The old lady gravely turned</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">examined the aquiline profile. ‘Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I       confess</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she remarked urbanely</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘you have the advantage of me.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford smiled uneasily. ‘Believe me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it is little advantage.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘My sight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Miss Sinnet precisely</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘is not so good as I might wish</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">though better perhaps than I might have hoped</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I fear I am not much wiser</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">your face is still unfamiliar to me.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘It is not unfamiliar to me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Lawford. Whose trickery was this? he       thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">putting such affected stuff into his mouth.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       A faint lightening of pity came into the silvery</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">scrupulous       countenance. ‘Ah</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said courteously.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford rested a lean hand on the seat. ‘And have you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he asked</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘not the       least recollection in the world of my face?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Now really</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">smiling blandly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘is that quite fair?

Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">let me think again. The last to leave me       was Fanny Urquhart</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that was—let me see—last October. Now you       are certainly not Fanny Urquhart’s son</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she stooped austerely</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘for she       never had one. Last year</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">too</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I heard that my dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear Mrs Jameson was       dead.

But</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if I may venture to say       so</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yours is not a Scottish face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she not only married a Scottish       husband</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but was herself a Dunbar. No</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I am still at a loss.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       A miserable strife was in her chance companion’s mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a strife of anger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">recrimination. He turned his eyes wearily to the fast declining sun.       ‘You will forgive my persistency</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but I assure you it is a matter of life       or death to me. Is there no one my face recalls? My voice?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Miss Sinnet drew her long lips together</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her eyebrows lifted with the       faintest perturbation. ‘But he certainly knows my name</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said to       herself. She turned once more</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the still autumnal beauty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beneath       that pale blue arch of evening</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">these two human beings confronted one       another again. She eyed him blandly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet with a certain grave directness.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I don’t really think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘you can be Mary Lawford’s son. I could       scarcely have mistaken HI<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr>’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford gulped</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned away. He hardly knew what this surge of feeling       meant. Was it hope</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">despair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">resentment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had he caught even the echo of an       unholy joy? His mind for a moment became confused as if in the tumult of a       struggle. He heard himself expostulate</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘Ah</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Miss Bennett</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I fear I set       you too difficult a task.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The old lady drew abruptly in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a trustful</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gentle snail into its       shocked house. ‘Bennett</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but my name is not Bennett.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       And again Lawford accepted the miserable prompting. ‘Not Bennett!... How       can I ever then apologise for so frantic a mistake?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The little old lady took firm hold of her umbrella. She did not answer       him. ‘The likeness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the likeness!’ he began unctuously</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stopped</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for       the glance that dwelt fleetingly on him was cold with the formidable       dignity</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">displeasure of age. He raised his hat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned miserably       home. He strode on out of the last gold into the blue twilight. What       fantastic foolery of mind was mastering him? He cast a hurried look over       his shoulder at the kindly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">offended old figure sitting there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">solitary</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on the little seat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in her great bonnet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with back turned       resolutely upon him—the friend of his dead mother who might have       proved in his need a friend indeed to him. And he had by this insane       caprice hopelessly estranged her.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She would remember this face well enough now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he thought bitterly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">would take her place among his quiet enemies</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if ever the day of reckoning       should come. It was scandalous</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it was banal to have abused her trust</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">courtesy. Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it was hopeless to struggle any more! The fates were against       him. They had played him a trick. He was to be their transitory sport</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as       many a better man he could himself recollect had been before him. He would       go home</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">give in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">let Sheila do with him what she pleased. No one but a       lunatic could have acted as he had</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with just that frantic hint of method       so remarkable in the insane.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He left the common. A lamplighter was lighting the lamps. A thin evening       haze was on the air. If only he had stayed at home that fateful afternoon!       Who</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">what had induced him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">enticed him to venture out? And even with the       thought welled up into his mind an intense desire to go to the old green       time-worn churchyard again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to sit there contentedly alone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">where none       heeded the completest metamorphosis</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">down beside the yew-trees. What a       fool he had been. There alone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lay his only possible chance of       recovery. He would go to-morrow. Perhaps Sheila had not yet discovered his       absence</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there would be no difficulty in repeating so successful a       stratagem.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Remembrance of his miserable mistake</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of Miss Sinnet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">faintly returned to       him as he swiftly mounted the steps to his porch. Poor old lady. He would       make amends for his discourtesy when he was quite himself again. She       should some day hear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his infinitely tragic</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">infinitely comic       experience from his own lips. He would take her some flowers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">some old       keepsake of his mother’s. What would he not do when the old moods</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">brains of the stupid Arthur Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">whom he had appreciated so little</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so superficially</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">came back to him.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He ran up the steps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stopped dead</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his hand in his pocket</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">chilled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">aghast. Sheila had taken his keys. He stood there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dazed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beneath the dim yellow of his own fanlight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">once again that inward       spring flew back. ‘Brazen it out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">brazen it out!

God forbid!’ said Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but his dark eyes failed to move       these lightest hazel. ‘Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he continued nonchalantly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘perhaps—perhaps       it—WOULD be as well if Mrs Lawford should know that I am here.

And there before him       in quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hostile decorum stood maid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">mistress. He took off his hat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stepped quickly in.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘So late</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so very late</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I fear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he began glibly. ‘A sudden call</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a       perfectly impossible distance.

So long as you       are like this</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yourself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">why I—What is it now?’ she broke       off querulously.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘If you please</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ma’am</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Mr Critchett says he doesn’t know Dr Ferguson</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his       name’s not in the Directory</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there must be something wrong with the       message</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he’s sorry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but he must have it in writing because there was       more even in the first packet than he ought by rights to send. What shall       I do</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if you please?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Still looking at her husband. Sheila listened quietly to the end</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if in inarticulate disdain</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she deliberately shrugged her       shoulders</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">went out to play her part unaided.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;a name=&quot;link2HCH0007&quot; id=&quot;link2HCH0007&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div style=&quot;height: 4em</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">&quot;&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;       CHAPTER SEVEN     &lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Her husband turned wearily once more</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drawing up a chair sat down in       front of the cold grate. He realised that Sheila thought him as much of a       fool now as she had for the moment thought him an impostor</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or something       worse</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the night before. That was at least something gained. He realised</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">too</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in a vague way that the exuberance of mind that had practically       invented Dr Ferguson</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">outraged Miss Sinnet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had quite suddenly       flickered out. It was astonishing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with gaze fixed innocently       on the black coals</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that he should ever have done such things. He detested       that kind of ‘rot’</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that jaunty theatrical pose so many men prided their       jackdaw brains on.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       And he sat quite still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a cat at a cranny</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listening</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as it were</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for       the faintest remotest stir that might hint at any return of this—activity.       It was the first really sane moment he had had since the ‘change.’        Whatever it was that had happened at Widderstone was now distinctly       weakening in effect. Why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps? He stole a thievish look over his       shoulder at the glass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cautiously drew finger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">thumb down that       beaked nose. Then he really quietly smiled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a smile he felt this       abominable facial caricature was quite unused to</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the superior Lawford       smile of guileless contempt for the fanatical</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the fantastic</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the       bizarre: He wouldn’t have sat with his feet on the fender before a       burnt-out fire.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       And the animosity of that ‘he</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ uttered only just under his breath</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">surprised even himself. It actually did seem as if there were a chance</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if       only he kept cool</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">collected. If the whole mind of a man was bent on       being one thing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">surely no power on earth</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">certainly not on earth</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">could       for long compel him to look another</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">any more  than vice versa.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       That</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in fact</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was the trick that had been in fitful fashion played him       since yesterday. Obviously</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">apart altogether from his promise to       Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the best possible thing he could do would be to walk quietly over       to Widderstone to-morrow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a child that has lost a penny</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just make       the attempt to reverse the process: look at the graves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">read the       inscriptions on the weather-beaten stones</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">compose himself once more to       sleep on the little seat.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Magic</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">witchcraft</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">possession</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">all that—well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Mr Bethany might       prefer to take it on the authority of the Bible if it was his duty. But it       was at least mainly Old Testament stuff</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like polygamy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Joshua</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the       ‘unclean beasts.’ The ‘unclean beasts.’ It was simply</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as Simon had said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">mainly an affair of the nerves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like Indian jugglery. He had heard of       dozens of such cases</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or similar cases. And it was hardly likely that       cases even remotely like his own would be much bragged about</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or       advertised. All those mysterious ‘disappearances</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ too</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">which one reads       about so repeatedly? What of them? Even now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he felt</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it would be better to think as softly as       possible</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not to hope too openly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">certainly not to triumph in the least       degree</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just in case of—well—listeners.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He would wrap up too. And he wouldn’t tell Sheila of the project till he       had come safely back. What an excellent joke it would be to confess meekly       to his escapade</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to be scolded</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then suddenly to reveal himself.       He sat back</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gazed with an almost malignant animosity at the face in       the portrait</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">comely</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">plump.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       An inarticulate</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unfathomable depression rolled back on him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a mist       out of the sea. He hastily undressed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">put watch</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">door-key</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Critchett’s powder under his pillow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">paused</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">vacantly ruminated</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then       replaced the powder in his waistcoat pocket</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">said his prayers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">got       shivering to bed. He did not feel hurt at Sheila’s leaving him like this.       So long as she really believed in him. And now—Alice was home. He       listened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">trying not to shiver</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for her voice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sometimes heard</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he       fancied</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the clear note. It was this beastly influenza that made him feel       so cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lifeless. But all would soon come right—that is</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if only       that face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">luminous against the floating darkness within</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">would not appear       the instant he closed his eyes.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       But legions of dreams are Influenza’s allies. He fell into a chill doze</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">heard voices innumerable</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">one above the rest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shouting them down</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">until there fell a lull. And another</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as it were</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">from afar said quite       clearly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">distinctly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘But surely</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you have heard the story of       the poor old charwoman who talked Greek in her delirium? A little school       French need not alarm us.’ And Lawford opened his eyes again on Mr Bethany       standing at his bed.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Tt</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tt! There</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I’ve been</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">waked him. And yet they say men make such       excellent nurses in time of war. But you see</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">what did I tell       you? Wasn’t I now an infallible prophet? Your wife has been giving me a       most glowing account. Quite your old self</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she tells me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">except for just       this—this touch of facial paralysis. And I think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">do you know’ —‘yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I really think there       is a decided improvement. Not quite so—drawn. We must make haste       slowly. Wedderburn</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">believes profoundly in Simon</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he pulled his       wife through a dangerous confinement. And here’s pills</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tonics</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">liniments—a whole chemist’s shop. Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">we are getting on swimmingly.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Flamelight was flickering in the candled dusk. Lawford turned his head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">saw Sheila’s coiled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beautiful hair in the firelight.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You haven’t told Alice?’ he asked.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘My dear good man</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Mr Bethany</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘of course we haven’t. You shall tell       her yourself on Monday. What an incredible tradition it will be! But you       mustn’t worry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you mustn’t even think. And no more of these jaunts</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">eh?       That Ferguson business—that was too bad. What are we going to do       with the fellow now we have created him? He will come home to roost—mark       my words. And as likely as not down the Vicarage chimney. I wouldn’t have       believed it of you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my dear fellow.’ He beamed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but looked</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">none the less</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very lean</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fagged</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">depressed.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘How did the wedding go off?’ Lawford managed to think of inquiring.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">A1</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Mr Bethany. ‘I’ve just been describing it to Alice—the       bride</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her bridegroom</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">mother</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">aunts</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cake</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">presents</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">finery</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">blushes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tears</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">everything that was hers.

And that it’s only Art that has kept me out of an apron. Now look here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no excitement</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no pranks. What is there to worry       about</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pray? And now Little Dorrit’s down with influenza too. And Craik</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I will have double work to do. Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">good-bye</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my dear. God       bless you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford. I can’t tell you how relieved</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how unspeakably       relieved I am to find you so much—so much better. Feed him up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my       other dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">body</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">soul</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">spirit. And there goes the bell. I       must have a biscuit. I’ve swallowed nothing but a Cupid in plaster of       Paris since breakfast. Goodnight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">we shall miss you both—both.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       But when Sheila returned</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her husband was sunk again into a quiet sleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">from which not even the many questions she fretted to put to him seemed       weighty enough to warrant his disturbance.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       So when Lawford again opened his eyes he found himself lying wide awake</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">clear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">refreshed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">eager to get up. But upon the air lay the still       hush of early morning. He tried in vain to catch back sleep again. A       distant shred of dream still floated in his mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a cloud at evening.       He rarely dreamed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but certainly something immensely interesting had but a       moment ago eluded him. He sat up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looked at the clear red cinders</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">their maze of grottoes. He got out of bed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">peeped through the blinds.       To the east</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">opposite to him gardens</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">an apple-orchard lay</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there in strange liquid tranquillity hung the morning star</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rifling into the dusk of night</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the first grey of dawn. The street beneath       its autumn leaves was vacant</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">charmed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">deserted.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Hardly since childhood had Lawford seen the dawn unless over his winter       breakfast-table. Very much like a child now he stood gazing out of his       bow-window—the child whom Time’s busy robins had long ago covered       over with the leaves of numberless hours. A vague exultation fumed up into       his brain. Still on the borders of sleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he unlocked the great wardrobe</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">took out an old faded purple</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">crimson dressing-gown that had       belonged to his grandfather</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the chief glory of every Christmas charade.       He pulled the cowl-like hood over his head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">strode majestically over to       the looking-glass.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He looked in there a moment on the strange face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a child dismayed at       its own excitement</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a fit of sobbing that was half uncontrollable       laughter swept over him. He threw off the hood</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned once more to the       window. Consciousness had flooded back indeed. What would Sheila have said       to see him there? The unearthly beauty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stillness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">man’s small       labours</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">garden</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wall</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">roof-tree idle</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">smokeless in the light of       daybreak—there seemed to be some half-told secret between them. What       had life done with him to leave a reality so clouded? He put on his       slippers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">and</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gently opening the door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">crept with extreme caution up the       stairs. At a long</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">narrow landing window he confronted a panorama of       starry night-gardens</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sloping orchards</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beyond them fields</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hills</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Orion</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Dogs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the clear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cloudless darkness.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘My God</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how beautiful!’ a voice whispered. And a cock crowed mistily       afar. He stood staring like a child into the wintry brightness of a       pastry-cook’s. Then once more he crept stealthily on. He stooped</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listened at a closed door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">until he fancied that above the beating of his       own heart he could hear the breathing of the sleeper within. Then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">taking       firm hold of the handle with both hands</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he slowly noiselessly turned it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">peeped in on Alice.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The moon was long past her faint shining here. The blind was down. And yet       it was not pitch dark. He stood with eyes fixed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">waiting. Then he edged       softly forward</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">knelt down beside the bed. He could hear her breathing       now: long</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">low</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unhastening—the miracle of life. He could       just dimly discern the darkness of her hair against the pillow. Some       long-sealed spring of tenderness seemed to rise in his heart with a grief</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">an ache he had never known before. Here at least he could find a       little peace</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a brief pause</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">however futile</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stupid all his hopes of       the night had been. He leant his head on his hands on the counterpane</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">refused to think. He felt a quick tremor</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a startled movement</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">knew       that eyes wide open with fear were striving to pierce the gloom between       them.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘There</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dearest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said in a low whisper</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘it’s only me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only       me.’ He stroked the narrow hand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gazed into the shadowiness. Her       fingers lay quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">passive in his</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with that strange sense of       immateriality that sleep brings to the body.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you!’ she answered with a deep sigh. ‘Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dearest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how you       frightened me. What is wrong? why have you come? Are you worse</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dearest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dearest?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He kissed her hand. ‘No</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not worse. I couldn’t sleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that was       all.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I came so utterly miserable to bed because you would not see me.       And Mother would tell me only so very little. I didn’t even know you had       been ill.’ She pressed his hand between her own. ‘But this</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">is       very</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very naughty—you will catch cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you bad thing. What would       Mother say?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I think we mustn’t tell her</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear. I couldn’t help it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I felt much I       wanted to see you. I have been rather miserable.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Why?’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stroking his hand from wrist to fingertips with one soft       finger. ‘You mustn’t be miserable. You</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">me have never done such a thing       before</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">have we? Was it that wretched old Flu?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It was too dark in the little fragrant room even to see her face so close       to his own. And yet he feared. ‘Dr Simon</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she went on softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘said it       was. But isn’t your voice a little hoarse</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it sounds so melancholy in       the dark. And oh’—she squeezed his wrist—‘you have grown so       thin! You do frighten me. Whatever should I do if you were really ill? And       it was so odd</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear. When first I woke I seemed to be still straining my       eyes in a dream</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at such a curious</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">haunting face—not very nice. I       am glad</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I am glad you were here.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What was the dream-face like?’ came the muttered question.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Dark</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sharp</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rather dwelling eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you know those long faces one       sees in dreams: like a hawk</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a conjuror’s.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Like a conjuror’s!—it was the first unguarded</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ungarbled       criticism. ‘Perhaps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if you find my voice different</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my hand       shrunk up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you will find my face changed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">too—like a conjuror’s....       What then?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She laughed gaily</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tenderly. ‘You silly silly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I should love you more       than ever. Your hands are icy cold. I can’t warm them nohow.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford held tight his daughter’s hand. ‘You do love me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice? You would       not turn against me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">whatever happened? Ah</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you shall see</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you shall see.’        A sudden burning hope sprang up in him. Surely when all was well again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">these last few hours would not have been spent in vain. Like the shadow of       death they had been</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">against whose darkness the green familiar earth seems       beautiful as the plains of paradise. Had he but realized before how much       he loved her—what years of life had been wasted in leaving it all       unsaid! He came back from his reverie to find his hand wet with her tears.       He stroked her hair</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">touched gently her eyelids without speaking.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You will let me come in to-morrow?’ she pleaded</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘you won’t keep me out?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Ah</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you must remember your mother. She gets so anxious</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">every word the doctor says is law. How would you like me to come again       like this</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps?—like Santa Claus?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You know how I love having you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stopped. ‘But—but...’        He leaned closer. ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">come</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">clutching his hand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hiding her eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘it is only my dream—that horrible</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dwelling face       in the dream</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it frightened me so.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford rose very slowly from his knees. He could feel in the dark his       brows drawn down</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there came a low</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sullen beating on his ear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he saw his       face as it were in dim outline against the dark. Rage</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rebellion surged       up in him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even his love could be turned to bitterness. Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">two could       play at any game! Alice sprang up in bed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">caught his sleeve. ‘Dearest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dearest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you must not be angry with me now!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He flung himself down beside the bed. Anger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">resentment died away. ‘You       are all I have left</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He stole back</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he had come</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the clear dawn to his bedroom.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It was not five yet. He put a few more coals on his fire</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">blew out the       night-light</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lay down. But it was impossible to rest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to remain       inactive. He would go down</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">search for that first volume of Quain.       Hallucination</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Influenza</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Insanity—why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila must have purposely       mislaid it. A rather formidable figure he looked</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">descending the stairs in       the grey dusk of daybreak. The breakfast-room was at the back of the       house. He tilted the blind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a faint light flowed in from the changing       colours of the sky. He opened the glass door of the little bookcase to the       right of the window</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ran eye</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">finger over the few rows of books.       But as he stood there with his back to the room</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just as the shadow of a       bird’s wing floats across the moonlight of a pool</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he became suddenly       conscious that something</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">somebody had passed across the doorway</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in       passing had looked in on him.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He stood motionless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listening</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but no sound broke the morning       slumbrousness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">except the faraway warbling of a thrush in the first light.       So sudden</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">transitory had been the experience that it seemed now to be       illusory</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet it had so caught him up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it had with so furtive</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sinister       a quietness broken in on his solitude</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that for a moment he dared not       move. A cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">indefinite sensation stole over him that he was being       watched</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that some dim</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">evil presence was behind him biding its time</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">patient</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stealthy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with eyes fixed unmovingly on him where he stood.       But</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">watch</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wait as silently as he might</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only the day broadened at the       window</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at last a narrow ray of sunlight stole trembling up into the       dusky bowl of the sky.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       At any rate Quain was found</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with all the ills of life</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">from A to I</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford turned back to his bondage with the book under his arm.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;a name=&quot;link2HCH0008&quot; id=&quot;link2HCH0008&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div style=&quot;height: 4em</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">&quot;&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;       CHAPTER EIGHT     &lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The Sabbath</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pale with September sunshine</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">monotonous with chiming       bells</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had passed languidly away. Dr Simon had come</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">optimistic</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">urbane</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet with a faint inward dissatisfaction over a patient behind       whose taciturnity a hint of mockery</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">subterfuge seemed to lurk. Even       Mrs Lawford had appeared to share her husband’s reticence. But Dr Simon       had happened on other cases in his experience where tact was required       rather than skill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">time than medicine.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The voices</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">footsteps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even the frou-frou of worshippers going to       church</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the voices</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">footsteps of worshippers returning from church</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had       floated up to the patient’s open window. Sunlight had drawn across his       room in one pale beam</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">vanished. A few callers had called. Hothouse       flowers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">waxen</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pale</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had been left with messages of sympathy. Even Dr       Critchett had respectfully</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">discreetly made inquiries on his way home       from chapel.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford had spent most of his time in pacing to</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fro in his soft       slippers. The very monotony had eased his mind. Now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">again he had lain       motionless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with his face to the ceiling. He had dozed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had awakened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">torpid with dream. He had hardly been aware of the process</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but       every hour had done something</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it seemed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">towards clarifying his point of       view. A consciousness had begun to stir in him that was neither that of       the old</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">easy Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">whom he had never been fully aware of before</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">nor       of this strange ghostly intelligence that haunted the hawklike</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">restless       face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">plucked so insistently at his distracted nerves. He had begun in       a vague fashion to be aware of them both</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">could in a fashion discriminate       between them</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">almost as if there really were two spirits in stubborn       conflict within him. It would</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wear him down in time. There       could be only one end to such a struggle—THE end.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       All day he had longed for freedom</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with craving for the open       sky</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for solitude</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for green silence</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beyond these maddening walls. This       heedful silken coming</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">going</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">these Sunday voices</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this reiterant yelp       of a single peevish bell—would they never cease? And above all</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">betwixt dread</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">an almost physical greed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he hungered for night. He sat       down with elbows on knees</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">head on his hands</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">thinking of night</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its       secrecy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its immeasurable solitude.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       His eyelids twitched</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the fire before him had for an instant gone black       out. He seemed to see slow-gesturing branches</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">grass stooping beneath a       grey</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wind-swept sky. He started up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the remembrance of the morning       returned to him—the glassy light</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the changing rays</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the beaming       gilt upon the useless books. Now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at last</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at the windows</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">afternoon had       begun to wane.

She put down the tray</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">paused       at the glass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looking across it out of the window.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Alice says you are to eat every one of those delicious sandwiches</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">especially the tiny omelette.

But I’m not</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">say what you       like</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">blind. You ARE pretty: I’d repeat it if I was burning at the stake.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Sheila lowered her eyes softly on to the rich-toned picture in the glass.       ‘Supposing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">watching her lips move</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘supposing—of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I know you are getting better</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">all that—but supposing you don’t       change back as Mr Bethany thinks</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">what will you do?

In spite of all her reason</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of her       absolute certainty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she wondered even again for a moment if this really       could be Arthur. And for the first time she realised the power</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">mastery       of that eager</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">far too hungry face. Her mind seemed to pause</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fluttering in air</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like a bird in the wind. She hastened rather unsteadily       to the door.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Will you want anything more</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">do you think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for an hour?’ she asked.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Her husband looked up over his little table. ‘Is Alice going with you?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Oh yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">poor child</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she looks so pale</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">miserable. We are going to Mrs       Sherwin’s</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then on to Church. You will lock your door?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I will lock my door.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘And I do hope Arthur—nothing rash!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       A change</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that seemed almost the effect of actual shadow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">came over his       face. ‘I wish you could stay with me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said slowly. ‘I don’t think you       have any idea what—what I go through.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It was as if a child had asked on the verge of terror for a candle in the       dark. But an hour’s terror is better than a lifetime of timidity. Sheila       sighed.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I too might say that. But there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">giving way will do       nothing for either of us. I shall be gone only for an hour</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or two at the       most. And I told Mr Bethany I should have to come out before the sermon:       it’s only Mr Craik.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘But why Mrs Sherwin? She’d worm a secret out of one’s grave.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘It’s useless to discuss that</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Arthur</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you have always consistently       disliked my friends. It’s scarcely likely that you would find any       improvement in them now.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">well—’ he began. But the door was already closed.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Sheila!’ he called in a burst of anger.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Arthur?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You have taken my latchkey.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Sheila came hastily in again. ‘Your latchkey?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I am going out.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘“Going out!”—you will not be so mad</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so criminal</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">after your       promise!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He stood up. ‘It is useless to argue. If I do not go out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I shall       certainly go mad. As for criminal—why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that’s a woman’s word. Who on       earth is to know me?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘It is of no consequence</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that the servants are already gossiping       about this impossible Dr Ferguson</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that you are certain to be seen either       going or returning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that Alice is bound to discover that you are well       enough to go out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet not even enough to say good-night to your own       daughter—oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it’s monstrous</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it’s a frantic</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a heartless thing to       do!’ Her voice vaguely suggested tears.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford eyed her coldly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stubbornly—thinking of the empty room he       would leave awaiting his return</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its lamp burning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its fire-flames       shining. It was almost a physical discomfort</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this longing unspeakable for       the twilight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the green secrecy</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the silence of the graves. ‘Keep them       out of the way</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said in a low voice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘it will be dark when I come in.’        His hardened face lit up. ‘It’s useless to attempt to dissuade me.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Why must you always be hurting me? why do you seem to delight in trying       to estrange me?’ Husband</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wife faced each other across the clear-lit       room. He did not answer.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘For the last time</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said in a quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hard voice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I ask you not to       go.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He shrugged his shoulders. ‘Ask me not to come back</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘that’s       nearer your hope.’ He turned his face to the fire. Without moving he heard       her go out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">return</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pause</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">go out again. And when he deliberately       wheeled round in his chair the little key lay conspicuous there on the       counterpane.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;a name=&quot;link2HCH0009&quot; id=&quot;link2HCH0009&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div style=&quot;height: 4em</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">&quot;&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;       CHAPTER NINE     &lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The last light of sunset lay in the west</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a sullen wrack of cloud was       mounting into the windless sky when Lawford entered the country graveyard       again by its dark weather-worn lych-gate. The old stone church with its       square tower stood amid trees</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its eastern window faintly aglow with       crimson</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">purple. He could hear a steady</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rather nasal voice through its       open lattices. But the stooping stones</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the cypresses were out of sight       of its porch. He would not be seen down there. He paused a moment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">however</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his hat was drawn down over his eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he was shivering. Far over       the harvest fields showed a growing pallor in the solitary seat beneath       the cypresses. He stood hesitating</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gazing steadily</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet half vacantly       at the motionless figure</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in a while a face was lifted in his       direction</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">undisconcerted eyes calmly surveyed him.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I am afraid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ called Lawford rather nervously—‘I hope I am not       intruding?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Not at all</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not at all</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said the stranger. ‘I have no privileges here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at least as yet.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford again hesitated</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then slowly advanced. ‘It’s astonishingly quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beautiful</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The stranger turned his head to glance over the fields. ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it is</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he replied. There was the faintest accent</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a little drawl of       unfriendliness in the remark.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You often sit here?’ Lawford persisted.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The stranger raised his eyebrows. ‘Oh yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">often.’ He smiled. ‘It is my       own modest fashion of attending divine service. The congregation is rapt.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘My visits</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘have been very few—in fact</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so far as I       know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I have only once been here before.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I envy you the novelty.’ There was again the same faint unmistakable       antagonism in voice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">attitude</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet so deep was the relief in       talking to a fellow creature who hadn’t the least suspicion of anything       unusual in his appearance that Lawford was extremely disinclined to turn       back. He made another effort—for conversation with strangers had       always been a difficulty to him—and advanced towards the seat. ‘You       mustn’t please let me intrude upon you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘but really I am very       interested in this queer old place. Perhaps you would tell me something of       its history?’ He sat down. His companion moved slowly to the other side of       the broken gravestone.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘To tell you the truth</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he replied</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">picking his way as it were from word       to word</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘it’s “history</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">” as people call it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">does not interest me in the       least. After all</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it’s not when a thing is</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but what it is</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that much       matters. What this is’—he glanced</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with head bent</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">across the       shadowy stones</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘is pretty evident. Of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">age has its charms.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘And is this very old?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Oh yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it’s old right enough</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as things go</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but even age</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">is       mainly an affair of the imagination.

That’s pretty good weathering.’ He       smiled faintly. ‘Of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the church itself is centuries older</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drenched       with age. But she’s still sleep-walking while these old tombstones dream.       Glow-worms</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">crickets are not such bad bedfellows.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What interested me most</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Lawford haltingly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘was this.’ He       pointed with his stick to the grave at his feet.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Ah</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sabathier’s</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said the stranger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I know his peculiar history       almost by heart.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford found himself staring with unusual concentration into the rather       long</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pale face. ‘Not</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I suppose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he resumed faintly—‘not</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I       suppose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beyond what’s there.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       His companion leant his hand on the old stooping tombstone. ‘Well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you       know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there’s a good deal there’—he stooped over—‘if you read       between the lines. Even if you don’t.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘A suicide</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">under his breath.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a suicide</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that’s why our Christian countrymen have buried him       outside of the fold.

It’s narrow quarters</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how would he begin?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford sat quite still. ‘You say—I hope I am not detaining you—you       say you have come here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sat here often</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on this very seat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">have you ever       had—have you ever fallen asleep here?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Why do you ask?’ inquired the other curiously.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I was only wondering</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Lawford. He was cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shivering. He felt       instinctively it was madness to sit on here in the thin gliding mist that       had gathered in swathes above the grass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">milk-pale in the rising moon. The       stranger turned away from him.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘“For in that sleep of death what dreams may come must give us pause</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">”’ he       said slowly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with a little satirical catch on the last word. ‘What did you       dream?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford glanced helplessly about him. The moon cast lean grey beams of       light between the cypresses. But to his wide</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wandering eyes it seemed       that a radiance other than hers haunted these mounds</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">leaning stones.       ‘Have you ever noticed it?’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">putting out his hand towards his       unknown companion</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘this stone is cracked from head to foot?...

You came here for solitude</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I have been trying to convince       you that we are surrounded with witnesses. You will forgive my intrusion?’        There was a kind of old-fashioned courtesy in his manner that he himself       was dimly aware of. He held out his hand.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I hope you will think nothing of the kind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said the other earnestly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘how could it be in any sense an intrusion?

At the porch they paused once more. And now       it was the stranger that held out his hand.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Perhaps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘you will give me the pleasure of some day continuing       our talk.

Perhaps you could spare the       time now?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford took out his watch</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘You are really very kind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said. ‘But</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps—well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">whatever that history may be</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I think you would agree       that mine is even—but</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I’ve talked too much about myself       already.

He heard voices in the       dining-room. A light shone faintly between the blinds of his bedroom. He       very gently let himself in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unheard</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unseen</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">mounted the stairs. He       sat down in front of the fire</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tired out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">bitterly cold in spite of his       long walk home. But his mind was wearier even than his body. He tried in       vain to catch up the thread of his thoughts. He only knew for certain that       so far as his first hope</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">motives had gone his errand had proved       entirely futile. ‘How could I possibly fall asleep with that fellow       talking there?’ he had said to himself angrily</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet knew in his heart that       their talk had driven every other idea out of his mind. He had not yet       even glanced into the glass. His every thought was vainly wandering round</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">round the one curious hint that had drifted in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but which he had not       yet been able to put into words.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Supposing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">though</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that he had really fallen into a deep sleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with none       to watch or spy—what then? However ridiculous that idea</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it was not       more ridiculous</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">more incredible than the actual fact. If he had remained       there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he might</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it was just possible that he would by now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">have actually       awakened just his own familiar every-day self again. And the thought of       that—though he hardly realised its full import—actually did       send him on tip-toe for a glance that more or less effectually set the       question at rest. And there looked out at him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it seemed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the same dark       sallow face that had so much appalled him only two nights ago—expressionless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cadaverous</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with shadowy hollows beneath the glittering eyes. And even as       he watched it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its lips</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of their own volition</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drew together</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">questioned him—‘Whose?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He was not to be given much leisure</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">however</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for fantastic reveries like       this.

He started up.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I wish you would knock</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said angrily</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘you talk of quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you tell me       to rest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">here you come creeping</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">spying on me as if I       was a child in a nursery.

He dressed by the       fireplace.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I couldn’t rest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he told Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">when she presently came in on one of       her quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cautious</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">heedful visits</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘and one tires of reading even Quain       in bed.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Have you found anything?’ she inquired politely.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Oh yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Lawford wearily</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I have discovered that infinitely worse       things are infinitely commoner.

With a glance of circumspection that almost seemed to suggest a       fear of pursuit</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he descended the steps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only to be made aware in so doing       that Ada was with a kind of furtive eagerness pointing out the mysterious       Dr Ferguson to a steadily gazing cook. One or two well-known</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">many a       well-remembered face he encountered in the thin stream of City men       treading blackly along the pavement.

His heart       sickened. Was it even worth while living on a crust of social       respectability so thin</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so exquisitely treacherous? He challenged no       one. One or two actual acquaintances raised</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lowered a faintly       inquiring eyebrow in his direction.

If the worst should come       to the worst</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">why—there is pasture in the solitary by-ways for the       beast that strays. He quickened his pace along lonelier streets</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">soon       strode freely through the little flagged</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cobbled village of shops</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">past the same small jutting window whose clock had told him the hour on       that first dark hurried night.

Shops were left behind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the last       milestone passed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in a little while he was descending the hill beneath       the elm boughs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">which he remembered had stood like a turreted wall against       the sunset when first he had wandered down into the churchyard.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       At the foot of the hill he passed by the green</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">white Rectory</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there was the parson</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a short fat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pursy man with wrists protruding from       his jacket sleeves as he stood on tip-toe tying up a rambling rose-shoot       on his trim cedared lawn. The next house barely showed its old red       chimney-tops</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">above its bowers</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the next was empty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with windows vacantly       gazing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its paths peopled with great bearded weeds that stood mutely       watching</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">guarding the seldom-opened gate. Then came more lofty       grandmotherly elms</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a dense hedge of every leaf that pricks</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then       Lawford found himself standing at the small canopied gate of the queer old       wooden house that the stranger of his talk had in part described.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It stood square</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">high</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dark in a small amphitheatre of verdure.       Roses here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there sprang from the grass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a narrow box-edged path       led to a small door in a low green-mantled wing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with its one square       window above the porch. And while</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with vacant mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford stood       waiting</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as one stands forebodingly upon the eve of a new experience he       heard as if at a distance the sound of falling water.

Herbert tapped his cigarette on the sill. ‘Just following       up our ludicrous conjecture</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he remarked musingly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘it wasn’t       such a bad opportunity for the poor chap.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘But surely</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">speaking as it were out of a dream of       candle-light</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">reverberating sound</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">clearest darkness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">towards this       strange deliberate phantom with the unruffled clear-cut features—‘surely       then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in that case</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he is here now?

You see—why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">everything       depends on struggling through: the future! But if you only knew—There!’        Again his arm swept out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the lean terrified face turned shuddering       from the dark.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I do know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">believe me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">believe me!

As if</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if I did not know what it is to be       afraid.

How thankful I am I came.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She had turned</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">they were steadily ascending as if pushing their way</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">battling on through some obstacle of the mind rather than of the senses       beneath the star-powdered callous vault of night. And it seemed to Lawford       as if</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as they pressed on together</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">some obscure detestable presence as       slowly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as doggedly had drawn worsted aside. He could see again the       peaceful outspread branches of the trees</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the lych-gate standing in       clear-cut silhouette against the liquid dusk of the sky. A strange calm       stole over his mind. The very meaning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">memory of his fear faded out</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">vanished</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as the passed-away clouds of a storm that leave a purer</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">serener       sky.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       They stopped</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stood together on the brow of the little hill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">still trembling from head to foot</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looked back across the hushed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lightless countryside. ‘It’s all gone now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said wearily</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘and now       there’s nothing left. You see</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I cannot even ask your forgiveness—and       a stranger!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Please don’t say that—unless—unless—a “pilgrim” too. I       think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">surely</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you must own we did have the best of it that time. Yes—and       I don’t care WHO may be listening—but we DID win through.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What can I say? How shall I explain? How shall I make you understand?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The clear grey eyes showed not the faintest perturbation. ‘But I do</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I do       indeed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in part</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I do understand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ever so faintly.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘And now I will come back with you.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       They paused in the darkness face to face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the silence of the sky</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">arched       in its vastness above the little hill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the only witness of their triumph.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She turned unquestioningly. And laughing softly almost as children do</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the       stalking shadows of a twilight wood behind them—they trod in silence       back to the house. They said good-bye at the gate</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford started       once more for home. He walked slowly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">conscious of an almost intolerable       weariness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if his strength had suddenly been wrested away from him. And       at some distance beyond the top of the hill he sat down on the bank beside       a nettled ditch</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with his book pressed down upon the wayside grass       struck a match</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">holding it low in the scented</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">windless air turned       slowly the cockled leaf.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Few of them were alike except for the dinginess of the print</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the       sinister smudge of the portraits. All were sewn roughly together into a       mould-stained</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">marbled cover. He lit a second match</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he did so       glanced as if inquiringly over his shoulder. And a score or so of pages       before the end he came at last upon the name he was seeking</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned       the page.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It was a likeness even more striking in its crudeness of ink</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">line</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">paper than the most finished of portraits could have been. It repelled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet it fascinated him. He had not for a moment doubted Herbert’s calm       conviction. And yet as he stooped in the grass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">closely scrutinising the       blurred obscure features</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he felt the faintest surprise not so much at the       significant resemblance but at his own composure</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his own steady</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unflinching confrontation with this sinister</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">intangible adversary. The       match burned down to his fingers. It hissed faintly in the grass.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He stuffed the book into his pocket</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stared into the pale dial of his       watch. It was a few minutes after eleven. Midnight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">would just see       him in. He rose stiffly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yawned in sheer exhaustion. Then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hesitating</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he turned his head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looked back towards the hollow. But a vague       foreboding held him back. A sour</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">vacuous incredulity swept over him.       What was the use of all this struggling</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">vexation. What gain in living       on? Once dead his sluggish spirit at least would find its rest. Dust to       dust it would indeed be for him. What else</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in sober earnest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had he been       all his daily stolid life but half dead</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">scarce conscious</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">without a       living thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or desire</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in head or heart?     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       And while he was still gloomily debating within himself he had turned       towards home</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">soon was walking in a kind of reverie</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even his extreme       tiredness in part forgotten</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only a far-away dogged recollection in       his mind that in spite of shame</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in spite of all his miserable weakness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the words had been uttered once for all</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in all sincerity</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘We DID win       through.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Yet a desolate</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">odd air of strangeness seemed to drape his unlighted       house as he stood looking up in a kind of furtive communion with its       windows. It affected him with that discomforting air of extreme</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">meaningless novelty that things very familiar sometimes take upon       themselves. In this leaden tiredness no impression could be trustworthy.       His lids shut of themselves as he softly mounted the steps. It seemed a       needlessly wide door that soundlessly admitted him. But however hard he       pressed the key his bedroom door remained stubbornly shut until he found       that it was already unlocked</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he had only to turn the handle. A       night-light burned in a little basin on the washstand. The room was hung</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as it were</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with the stillness of night. And half lying on the bed in her       dressing-gown</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her head leaning on the rail at the foot</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was Alice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just       as sleep had overtaken her.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford returned to the door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listened. It seemed he heard a voice       talking downstairs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet not talking</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for it ran on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on in an       incessant slightly argumentative monotony that had neither break nor       interruption. He closed the door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stooping laid his hand softly on       Alice’s narrow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">still childish hand that lay half-folded on her knee. Her       eyes opened instantly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">gazed widely into his face. A slow vacant smile       of sleep came</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">went</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her fingers tightened gently over his as again       her lids drooped down over the drowsy blue eyes.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘At last</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at last</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I have been waiting such a time. But       we mustn’t talk much. Mother is waiting up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">reading.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Faintly through the close-shut door came the sound of that distant       expressionless voice monotonously rising</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">falling.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Why didn’t you tell me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear?’ Alice still sleepily whispered. ‘Would I       have asked a single question? How could I? Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if you had only trusted       me!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘But the change—the change</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice! You must have seen that. You       spoke to me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you did think I was only a stranger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even when you knew</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it was only fear on your face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dearest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">aversion</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you turned to       your mother first.

I do feel that.

I know I was       perplexed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I didn’t understand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but that was all. Why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even when you came       up in the dark</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">we talked—if you only knew how miserable I had       been—though I knew even then there was something different</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">still I       was not a bit afraid. Was I? And shouldn’t I have been afraid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">horribly       afraid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">if YOU had not been YOU?’ She repressed a little shudder</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">clasped his hand more closely. ‘Don’t let us say anything more about it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she implored him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘we are just together again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that is all that       matters.’ But her words were like brave soldiers who have fought their way       through an ambuscade but have left all confidence behind them.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford listened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that was enough just now—that she still</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in       spite of doubt</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">believed in him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cared for him. He was too       tired to have refused the least kindness.

And</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just as he       was</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he almost instantly fell asleep. He woke in the darkness to find       himself alone. He groped his way heavily to the door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned the       handle. But now it was really locked. Energy failed him. ‘I suppose—Sheila...’        he muttered.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;a name=&quot;link2HCH0014&quot; id=&quot;link2HCH0014&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div style=&quot;height: 4em</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">&quot;&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;       CHAPTER FOURTEEN     &lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">calm</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">alert</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">reserved</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was sitting at the open window when he       awoke again. His breakfast tray stood on a little table beside the bed. He       raised himself on his elbow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looked at his wife. The morning light       shone full on her features as she turned quickly at sound of his stirring.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘You have slept late</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in a low</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">mellow voice.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Have I</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sheila? I suppose I was tired out.

Round</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">round in dizzy       sickening flare</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">clatter his thoughts whirled.

He munched on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hungry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">tired. His night walk had cooled       head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">heart. Having obstinately refused Mr Bethany’s invitation to       sleep at the Vicarage</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he had sat down on an old low wall</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">watched       until his light had shone out at his bedroom window.

And now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he sat hungrily devouring his breakfast on the       table in the kitchen</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with the daybreak comforting his eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he thought       with a positive mockery of that poor old night-thing he had given inch by       inch into the safe keeping of his pink</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">white drawing-room.

He laved his eyelids in       it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as in a woodland brook after the heat of noon. He sat on in calmest       reverie till his hunger was satisfied.

The little woman stood with       arms folded over an empty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">capacious bag</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with an air of sustained       melancholy on her friendly face. She wished him a very nervous ‘Good       morning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dived down into the kitchen. The hours dragged slowly by in       a silence broken only by an occasional ring at the bell. About three she       emerged from the house</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">climbed the area steps with her bag hooked over       her arm. He watched the little black figure out of sight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">watched a man in       a white canvas hat ascend the steps to push a blue-printed circular       through the letter-box. It had begun to rain a little.

The man himself</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">breathing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">thinking</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">began to live for Lawford even in those few half-articulate       pages</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">though not in quite so formidable a fashion as Mr Bethany had       summed him up. But as the west began to lighten with the declining sun</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the same old disquietude</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the same old friendless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">foreboding ennui       stole over Lawford’s solitude once more. He shut his books</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">placed a       candlestick</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">two boxes of matches on the hall table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lit a bead of gas</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">went out into the rainy-sweet streets again.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       At a mean little barber’s with a pole above his lettered door he went in       to be shaved. And a few steps further on he sat down at the crumb-littered       counter of a little baker’s shop to have some tea. It pleased him almost       to childishness to find how easily he could listen</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even talk to the       oiled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">crimpy little barber</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to the pretty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">consumptive-looking</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">print-dressed baker’s wife. Whatever his face might now be conniving at</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Arthur Lawford of last week could never have hob-nobbed so affably       with his social ‘inferiors.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       For no reason in the world</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unless to spend a moment or two longer in the       friendly baker’s shop</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he bought six-penny-worth of cakes.

Wooden?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford looked into her face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but could find nothing more to say</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so he       smiled again rather absently</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ascended into the street.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He sat down outside the churchyard gate on the very bank where he had in       the sourness of the nettles first opened Sabathier’s Memoirs. The world       lay still beneath the pale sky. Presently the little fat rector walked up       the hill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his wrists still showing beneath his sleeves. Lawford       meditatively watched him pass by. A small boy with a switch</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a tiny nose</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a swinging gallipot</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his cheeks lit with the sunset</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">followed soon       after. Lawford beckoned him with his finger</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">held out the bag of tarts.       He watched him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">half incredulous of his prize</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with many a cautious       look over his shoulder</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pass out of sight. For a long while he sat alone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only the evening birds singing out of the greenness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">silence of the       churchyard. What a haunting inescapable riddle life was.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Colour suddenly faded out of the light streaming between the branches. And       depression</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">always lying in ambush of the novelty of his freedom</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">began       like mist to rise above his restless thoughts. It was all so devilish       empty—this raft of the world floating under evening’s shadow. How       many sermons had he listened to</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">enriched with the simile of the ocean of       life. Here they were</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">come home to roost. He had fallen asleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ineffectual sailor that he was</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a thief out of the cloudy deep had       stolen oar</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sail</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">compass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">leaving him adrift amid the riding of the       waves.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Are they worth</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">do you think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">quite a penny?’ suddenly inquired a quiet       voice in the silence. He looked up into the almost colourless face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">into       the grey eyes beneath their clear narrow brows.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I was thinking</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘what a curious thing life is</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wondering—’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘The first half is well worth the penny—its originality! I can’t       afford twopence. So you must GIVE me what you were wondering.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford gazed rather blankly across the twilight fields. ‘I was       wondering</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said with an oddly naive candour</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘how long it took one to       sink.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘They say</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ Grisel replied solemnly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘drowned sailors float       midway</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">suffering their sea change</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">purgatory. But what a splendid       pennyworth. All pure philosophy!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘“Philosophy!”’ said Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘I am a perfect fool. Has your brother told       you about me?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She glanced at him quickly. ‘We had a talk.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Then you do know—?’ He stopped dead</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned to her. ‘You really       realise it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looking at me now?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I realise</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she said gravely</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘that you look even a little more pale</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">haggard than when I saw you first the other night.

In fact</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I went       into the Widderstone in the evening to look for you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">knowing your       nocturnal habits....’ She glanced again at him with a kind of shy anxiety.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Why—why is your brother so—why does he let me bore him so       horribly?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Does he? He’s tremendously interested</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he’s pretty easily       interested when he’s interested at all. If he can possibly twist anything       into the slightest show of a mystery</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he will. But</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you won’t</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you can’t</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">take all he says seriously. The tiniest pinch of salt</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you       know. He’s an absolute fanatic at talking in the air. Besides</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it doesn’t       really matter much.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘In the air?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I mean if once a theory gets into his head—the more far-fetched</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so       long as it’s original</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the better—it flowers out into a positive       miracle of incredibilities. And of course you can rout out evidence for       anything under the sun from his dingy old folios. Why did he lend you that       PARTICULAR book?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Didn’t he tell you that</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘He said it was Sabathier.’ She seemed to think intensely for the merest       fraction of a moment</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned. ‘Honestly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">though</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I think he immensely       exaggerated the likeness.

My childhood was one long</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">reiterated terror—nights</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">nights of       it. But I never had the pluck to tell any one.

Ah</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you didn’t see either that my heart was       absolutely in my mouth</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that I was shrivelled up with fear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even at sight       of the fear on your face in the dark.

A coward! May I really say that to ask my help was one of the bravest       things in a man I ever heard of. Bullets—that kind of courage—no       real woman cares twopence for bullets.

He stood once more before the       looking-glass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">hearing again Grisel’s words in the still green shadow of       the beech-tree</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘Except of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">horribly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">horribly ill.’ ‘What a fool</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">what a coward she thinks I am!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       There was still nearly an hour to be spent in this great barn of faded       interests. He lit a candle</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">descended into the kitchen. A mouse went       scampering to its hole as he pushed open the door. The memory of that       ravenous morning meal nauseated him. It was sour</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">very still here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he       stood erect</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the air smelt faint of earth. In the breakfast-room the       bookcase still swung open. Late evening mantled the garden</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in sheer       ennui again he sat down to the table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">turned for a last not unfriendly       hob-a-nob with his poor old friend Sabathier. He would take the thing       back. Herbert</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was going to translate it for him. Now if the       patient old Frenchman had stormed Herbert instead—that surely would       have been something like a coup! Those frenzied books. The absurd talk of       the man. Herbert was perfectly right—he could have entertained fifty       old Huguenots without turning a hair. ‘I’m such an awful stodge.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He turned the woolly leaves over very slowly. He frowned impatiently</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">from the end backwards turned them over again. Then he laid the book       softly down on the table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sat back. He stared with narrowed lids into       the flame of his quiet friendly candle. Every trace</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">every shred of       portrait</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">memoir were gone. Once more</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">deliberately</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">punctiliously</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he       examined page by page the blurred</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unfamiliar French—the sooty       heads</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the long</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lean noses</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the baggy eyes passing like figures in a       peepshow one by one under his hand—to the last fragmentary</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dexterously mended leaf. Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sabathier was gone. Quite the old slow       Lawford smile crept over his face at the discovery. It was a smile a       little sheepish too</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he thought of Sheila’s quiet vigilance.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       And the next instant he had looked up sharply</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with a sudden peculiar       shrug</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a kind of cry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like the first thin cry of an awakened child</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in       his mind. Without a moment’s hesitation he climbed swiftly upstairs again       to the big sepulchral bedroom. He pressed with his fingernail the tiny       spring in the looking-glass. The empty drawer flew open. There were       finger-marks still in the dust.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Yet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">strangely enough</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beneath all the clashing thoughts that came       flocking into his mind as he stood with the empty drawer in his hand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was       a wounding yet still a little amused pity for his old friend Mr Bethany.       So far as he himself was concerned the discovery—well</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he would have       plenty of time to consider everything that could possibly now concern       himself. Anyhow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it could only simplify matters.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He remembered waking to that old wave of sickening horror on the first       unhappy morning</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he remembered the keen yet owlish old face blinking its       deathless friendliness at him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the steady pressure of the cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">skinny       hand. As for Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">she had never done anything by halves</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">certainly not       when it came to throwing over a friend no longer necessary to one’s social       satisfaction. But she would edge out cleverly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">magnanimously</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">triumphantly       enough</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no doubt</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">when the day of reckoning should come</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the day when</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her       nets wide spread</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her bait prepared</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he must stand up before her outraged       circle</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">positively prove himself her lawful husband</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps even to       the very imprint of his thumb.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Poor old thing!’ he said again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">this time his pity was shared almost       equally between both witnesses to Mr Bethany’s ingenuous little document</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the loss of which had fallen so softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pathetically that he felt only       ashamed of having discovered it so soon.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He shut back the tell-tale drawer</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">after trying to collect his       thoughts in case anything should have been forgotten</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he turned with a       deep trembling sigh to descend the stairs. But on the landing he drew back       at the sound of voices</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then a footstep. Soon came the sound of a key       in the lock. He blew out his candle</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">leant listening over the       balusters.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Who’s there?’ he called quietly.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ came the feeble reply out of the darkness.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What is it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Ada? What have you come for?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Only</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to see that all was safe</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you were in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said. ‘All’s safe</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I am in. What if I had been out?’ It was       like dropping tiny pebbles into a deep well—so long after came the       answering feeble splash.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Then I was to go back</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir.’ And a moment after the discreet voice       floated up with the faintest tinge of effrontery out of the hush. ‘Is that       Dr Ferguson</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">too sir?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘No</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Ada</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">please tell your mistress from me that Dr Ferguson is       unlikely to call again.’ A keen but rather forlorn smile passed over his       face. ‘He’s dining with friends no doubt at Holloway. But of course if she       should want to see him he will see her to-morrow at any hour at Mrs       Lovat’s. And—Ada!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Say that I’m a little better</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">your mistress will be relieved to hear that       I’m a little better</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">still not quite myself say</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a little       better.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I’m sure I’m very glad to hear it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ came fainter still.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What voice was that I heard just now?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Miss Alice’s</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but she came quite against my wishes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I hope you       won’t repeat it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir. She promised if she came that mistress shouldn’t       know. I was only afraid she might disturb you</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or—or Dr Ferguson.       And did you say</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sir</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that I was to tell mistress that he MIGHT be coming       back?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Ah</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that I don’t know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so perhaps it would be as well not to mention him       at all. Is Miss Alice there?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I said I would tell her if you were alone. But I hope you’ll understand       that it was only because she begged so. Mistress has gone to St Peter’s       bazaar</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that’s how it was.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I quite understand. Beckon to her.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       There came a hasty step in the hall</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a hurried murmur of explanation.       Lawford heard her call as she ran up the stairs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the next moment he       had Alice’s hand in his</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">they were groping together through the       gloaming back into the solitude of the empty room again.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Don’t be alarmed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he heard himself imploring. Just hold tight to       that clear common sense</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">above all you won’t tell? It must be our       secret</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a dead</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dead secret from every one</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even your mother</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">for just a       little while</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just a mere two days or so—in case. I’m—I’m       better</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He fumbled with the little box of matches</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dropped one</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">broke another</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but       at last the candle-flame dipped</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">brightened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with the door shut</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the last pale blueness of dusk at the window Lawford turned</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looked at       his daughter. She stood with eyes wide open</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like the eyes of a child       walking in its sleep</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then twisted her fingers more tightly within his.       ‘Oh</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dearest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how ill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">how ill you look</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she whispered. ‘But there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">never       mind—never mind. It was all a miserable dream</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it won’t</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it       can’t come back?

And mother       told me such curious things</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if I were a child</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">understood nothing.       And even after I knew that you were you—I mean before I sat up here       in the dark to see you—she said that you were gone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">would never       come back</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that a terrible thing had happened—a disgrace which we       must never speak of</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that all the other was only a pretence to keep       people from talking.

But here I am</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not nearly so ill as I look</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there’s nothing more to trouble ourselves about</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not even if it should be       necessary for me to go away for a time.

And faintly along the       hushed road Lawford heard in the silence a leisurely indolent beat of       little hoofs approaching</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the sound of wheels. A sudden wave of       feeling swept over him. He took Alice’s quiet loving face in his hands</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">kissed her passionately. ‘Do not so much as think of me yet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or doubt</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or       question: only love me</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dearest. And soon—and soon—’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘We’ll just begin again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just begin again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">won’t we? all three of us       together</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just as we used to be.

You’ll let me tell her soon?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The haggard face turned slowly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listening. ‘I hear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I understand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but I       can’t think very clearly now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I can’t</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my miserable old       tangled nerves.

Alice went slowly down</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but at the foot of the stairs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looking       out into the cold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">blue</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lamplit street she paused as if at a sudden       recollection</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ran hastily up again.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘There was nothing more</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dear?’ She said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">leaning back to peer up.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘“Nothing more?” What?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She stood panting a little in the darkness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listening to some cautious yet       uneasy thought that seemed to haunt her mind. ‘I thought—it seemed       there was something we had not said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">something I could not understand. But       there</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it is nothing! You know what a fanciful old silly I am. You do love       me?

His pulses were beating in his ear with a       low muffled roar. He looked down between the blinds to where against the       blue of the road beneath the straggling yellow beams of the lamp stood the       little cart</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drooping</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shaggy pony</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Grisel sitting quietly there       awaiting him. He shut his eyes as if in hope by some convulsive effort of       mind to break through this subtle glasslike atmosphere of dream that had       stolen over consciousness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">blotted out the significance</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">almost the       meaning of the past. He turned abruptly. Empty as the empty rooms around       him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unanswering were mind</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">heart. Life was a tale told by an idiot—signifying       nothing.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He paused at the head of the staircase. And even then the doubt confronted       him: Would he ever come back? Who knows? he thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">again stood       pondering</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">arguing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">denying. At last he seemed to have come to a decision.       He made his way downstairs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">opened</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">left ajar a long narrow window in a       passage to the garden beyond the kitchen. He turned on his heel as he       reached the gate</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">waved his hand as if in a kind of forlorn mockery       towards the darkly glittering windows. The drowsy pony awoke at touch of       the whip.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Grisel lifted the rug</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">squeezed a little closer into the corner. She       had drawn a veil over her face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">so that to Lawford her eyes seemed to be       dreaming in a little darkness of their own as he laid his hand on the side       of the cart. ‘It’s a most curious thing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘but peeping down at       you just now when the sound of the wheels came</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a memory came clearly back       to me of years</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">years ago—of my mother.

It was a little side       staircase window</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I was horribly homesick. And she came quite       unexpectedly. I shall never forget it—the misery</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">then</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her       coming.’ He lifted his eyes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cowed with the incessant struggle</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">watched her face for some time in silence. ‘Ought I to stay?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I see no “ought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">”’ she said. ‘No one is there?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Only a miserable broken voice out of a broken cage—called       Conscience.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Don’t you think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that even that has a good many disguises—convention</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">cowardice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">weakness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">ennui</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">they all take their turn at hooting in its       feathers?

Come now. It’s growing late.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       The little village echoed back from its stone walls the clatter of the       pony’s hoofs. Night had darkened to its deepest when their lamp shone       white on the wicket in the hedge. They had scarcely spoken. Lawford had       simply watched pass by</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">almost without a thought</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the arching trees</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the       darkening fields</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had watched rise up in a mist of primrose light the       harvest moon to shine in saffron on the faces</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shoulders of the few       wayfarers they met</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">or who passed them by. The still grave face beneath       the shadow of its veil had never turned</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">though the moon poured all her       flood of brilliance upon the dark profile. And once when as if in sudden       alarm he had lifted his head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looked at her</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a sudden doubt had       assailed him so instantly that he had half put out his hand to touch her</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">had as quickly withdrawn it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lest her beauty</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stillness should be</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even as the moment’s fancy had suggested</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">only a far-gone memory returned       in dream.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Herbert hailed them from the darkness of an open window. He came down</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">they talked a little in the cold air of the garden. He lit a cigarette</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">climbed languidly into the cart</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drove the drowsy little pony off       into the moonlight.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;a name=&quot;link2HCH0020&quot; id=&quot;link2HCH0020&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div style=&quot;height: 4em</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">&quot;&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;       CHAPTER TWENTY     &lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       It was a quiet supper the three friends sat down to.

Her face with its strange smile</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">her eyes with their still pity</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rapt courage had taken hope away. ‘Here’s not your rest</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ cried one       insistent voice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘she is the mystery that haunts day</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">night</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">past all       the changing of the restless hours.

He saw their       sharp-beaked heads turn this way</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that way</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as they floated on outspread       wings across the misty world. Except for the hoarse roar of the water       under the huge thin-leafed trees</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not a sound was stirring. ‘One thing</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’        he seemed to hear himself mutter as he turned with a shiver from the       morning air</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘it won’t be for long.

Not the echo of       triumph nor even a sigh of relief stirred the torpor of his mind. He knew       vaguely that what had been the misery</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">madness of the last few days was       gone. But the thought had no power to move him now. Sheila’s good sense</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Mr Bethany’s stubborn loyalty were alike old stories that had lost       their savour</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">meaning. Gone</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">too</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was the need for that portentous       family gathering that had sat so often in his fancy during these last few       days around his dining-room table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">discussing with futile decorum the       problem of how to hush him up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to muffle him down. Half dreaming</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">half       awake</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he saw the familiar door slowly open and</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">like the timely hero in a       melodrama</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his own figure appear before the stricken</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">astonished       company. His eyes opened half-fearfully</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">glanced up in the morning       twilight. Their perplexity gave place to a quiet</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">almost vacant smile</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the       lids slowly closed again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">at last the lean hands twitched awhile in       sleep.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Next morning he spent rummaging among the old books</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dipping listlessly       here</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">there as the tasteless fancy took him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">while Herbert sat writing       with serene face</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lifted eyebrows at his open window.

I get       muddled up with other things groping through the dictionary.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Herbert surveyed him critically. ‘What exactly is your interest now</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford?

Before noon the three of       them had set out on their walk across the fields.

Herbert stretched himself with his back to the earth</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">his placid face       to the pale vacant sky</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">while Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">even more dispirited after his       walk</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wandered up to the crest of the hill.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       At the foot of the hill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">upon the other side</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lay a farm</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">its       out-buildings</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a pool of water beneath a group of elms. It was vacant       in the sunlight</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the water vividly green with a scum of weed. And       about half a mile beyond stood a cluster of cottages</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">an old towered       church. He gazed idly down</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listening vaguely to the wailing of a curlew       flitting anxiously to</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fro above the broken solitude of its green hill.       And it seemed as if a thin</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">dark cloud began to be quietly withdrawn       from over his eyes. Hill</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wailing cry</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">barn</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">water faded out. And       he was staring as if in an endless stillness at an open window against       which the sun was beating in a bristling torrent of gold</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">while out of the       garden beyond came the voice of some evening bird singing with such an       unspeakable ecstasy of grief it seemed it must be perched upon the       confines of another world. The light gathered to a radiance almost       intolerable</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">driving back with its raining beams some memory</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">forlorn</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">remorseless</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">remote.

He turned unsteadily</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">made his way</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as if through a thick</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drizzling haze</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">slowly back.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘What is that—there?’ he said almost menacingly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">standing with       bloodshot eyes looking down upon Herbert.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘“That!”—what?’ said Herbert</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">glancing up startled from his book.       ‘Why</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">what’s wrong</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘That</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Lawford sullenly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yet with a faintly mournful cadence in his       voice</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘those fields</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that old empty farm—that village over       there? Why did you bring me here?’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Grisel had not stirred. ‘The village...’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Ssh!’ she said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">catching her brother’s sleeve</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘that’s Detcham</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Detcham.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford turned wide vacant eyes on her. He shook his head</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">shuddered.       ‘No</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">no</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">not Detcham.

Don’t ask me—a dream.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Grisel leaned forward</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">touched his hand. ‘Don’t think</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">don’t even try.       Why should you?

Once—’ But again the thread running so faintly through that       inextricable maze of memory eluded him. ‘So long as you won’t leave me       now!’ he implored her.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       She was vainly trying to win back her composure</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">could not answer him       at once....     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       In the evening after supper Grisel sat her guest down in front of a big       wood fire in the old book-room</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">where</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">staring into the playing flames</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he       could fall at peace into the almost motionless reverie which he seemed       merely to harass</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">weary himself by trying to disperse. She opened the       little piano at the far end of the room</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">played on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on as fancy led—Chopin</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Beethoven</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">a fugue from Bach</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lovely forlorn old English airs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">till the music seemed not only a voice persuading</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pondering</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">lamenting</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but gathered about itself the hollow surge of the water</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the       darkness</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wistful</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">clear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as the thoughts of a solitary child.

At last the       music</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">too</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">fell silent</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Lawford stood up with his candle in his hand</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">eyed with a strange fixity brother</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">sister.

But if once the—the others thought there had been any       tampering’—he tapped his forehead meaningly—‘here: if once       they thought that</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">it would</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you know</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">be quite over then.

The imagination</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the appeal faded: we’re       dead.’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford opened his mouth</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘TEMPORARILY tepid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he at last all but coughed       out.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Oh yes</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of course</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ said Herbert intelligently. ‘Only temporarily. It’s       this beastly gregariousness that’s the devil. The very thought of it       undoes me—with an absolute shock of sheepishness.

We are such       miserably dull company to one another it would be a greater pleasure to       have you with us than I can say. I mean it from the very bottom of my       heart. Do!’      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       Lawford listened. ‘I wish—</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ he began</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stopped dead again.       ‘Anyhow</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">I’ll go back.

The thinnest beam of light besprinkled       his eyes with curious brilliance.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       As quietly as some nocturnal creature he ascended the steps to the porch</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">leaning between stone pilaster</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">wall</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">listened intently for any       rumour of those within.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       He heard a clear</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rather languid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">delicate voice quietly speak on until       it broke into a little peal of laughter</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">followed</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">when it fell silent by       Sheila’s—rapid</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">rich</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">low.

Nothing there was visible but       a narrow strip of the white table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on which lay a black cotton glove</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beyond</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the glint of a copper pan. What made all these mute</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">inanimate       things so coldly hostile?     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       An extreme</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">almost nauseous distaste filled him at the thought of knocking       for admission</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of confronting Ada</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">possibly even Sheila</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the cold       echoing gloom of the detestable porch</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">of meeting the first wild</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">almost       metallic</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">flash of recognition. He swept softly down again</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">paused at       the open gate. Once before the voices of the night had called him: they       would not summon him forever in vain.

He       narrowed his lids</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">smiled up at the vacuous unfriendly house. Then       wheeling</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">on a sudden impulse he groped his way down the gravel path that       led into the garden. As he had left it</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the long white window was ajar.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       With extreme caution he pushed it noiselessly up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">climbed in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">stood listening again in the black passage on the other side. When he had       fully recovered his breath</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the knocking of his heart was stilled</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he       trod on softly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">till turning the corner he came in sight of the kitchen       door. It was now narrowly open</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">just enough</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">perhaps</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">to admit a cat</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"></b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as he softly approached</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">looking steadily in</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he could see Ada sitting at       the empty table</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">beneath the single whistling chandelier</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in her black       dress</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">black straw hat. She was reading apparently</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but her back was       turned to him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he could not distinguish her arm beyond the elbow. Then       almost in an instant he discovered</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">as</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">drawn up</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">unstirring he gazed       on</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">that she was not reading</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but had covertly</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">instantaneously raised       her eyes from the print on the table beneath</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">was transfixedly       listening too. He turned his eyes away</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">waited. When again he peered in       she had apparently bent once more over her magazine</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he stole on.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       One by one</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with a thin remote exultation in his progress</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he mounted the       kitchen stairs</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">with each deliberate</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">groping step the voices above       him became more clearly audible. At last</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">in the darkness of the hall</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">but       faintly stirred by the gleam of lamplight from the chink of the       dining-room door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">he stood on the threshold of the drawing-room door</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">could hear with varying distinctness what those friendly voices were so       absorbedly discussing.

None the less</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the leisurely       descent became in their company something of a real experience even in       such a brimming week.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘I hope</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">some day</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">you will really tell me your dream?’ he said</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">pushing       the old lady’s silk skirts in after her as she slowly climbed into the       carriage.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       ‘Ah</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">my dear Lawford</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">when you are my age</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">’ she called back to him</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">groping her way into the rather musty gloom</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">‘you’ll dream such dreams for       yourself.

In this old haunted house</b>, <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">amid this shallow turmoil no practicable clue could show itself of a way       out.
